2058	771265126	DMT: The Spirit Molecule	The Spirit Molecule investigates dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous psychoactive compound, which exists in humans and numerous species of plants and animals. The documentary traces Dr. Rick Strassman's government-sanctioned, human DMT research and its many trials, tribulations, and inconceivable realizations. A closer examination of DMT's effects through the lens of two traditionally opposed concepts, science and spirituality, The Spirit Molecule explores the connections between cutting-edge neuroscience, quantum physics, and human spirituality. Strassman's research, and the experiences of the human test subjects before, during, and after the intense clinical trials, raises many intriguing questions. A variety of experts voice their unique thoughts and experiences with DMT within their respective fields. As Strassman's story unfolds, the contributors weigh in on his remarkable theories, including the synthesis of DMT in our brain's pineal gland, its link to near-death & alien-abduction experiences, the history/future of psychedelics, and the uncanny likeness to ancient religious texts describing prophets with DMT-like experiences. Additionally, the intriguing similarities to the "many-worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics lead to other fascinating discoveries. The experts offer a comprehensive collection of information, opinions, and speculation to help understand the nature of the DMT experience, and its role in human culture and the life force of our planet. Due to the profound nature, and visual phantasmagoria, of the DMT experience, the visual landscape of the film features stunning visualizations from Scott Draves (Electric Sheep), as well as a cutting-edge motion graphics, which demonstrate DMT's conceptual link to human evolution, construction of the universe, advanced neuroscience, and other alluring theories. Finally, stylized scenes reminiscent of Rod Sterling's famous Twilight Zone bookends, Joe Rogan (actor/comedian) serves as tour guide, helping navigate the expansive realms of Strassman's DMT universe. Dimethyltryptamine: a simple molecule with enormous implications. The Spirit Molecule's subtle combination of science, spirituality, and philosophy results in an abundance of incredible ideas and theories that could alter the way we understand the universe and our relationship to it.	http://resizing.flixster.com/llGHj48BjNh96uBOfpGdchrqiPw=/175x239/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/27/11162708_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/llGHj48BjNh96uBOfpGdchrqiPw=/175x239/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/27/11162708_ori.jpg	Documentary	Mitch Schultz	Mitch Schultz, Rick Strassman (book)	01 Sep 2014	N/A	2012-05-03	2013-08-29	75 min	N/A	Joe Rogan, Ralph Abraham, Joel Bakst, Steven Barker	\N	dmt-the-spirit-molecule	0.0	dmtthespiritmolecule	0.0

In the US, farm labor has always been one of the most difficult and poorly paid jobs and has relied on some of the nation's most vulnerable people. While the legal restrictions which kept people bound to farms, like slavery, have been abolished, exploitation still exists, ranging from wage theft to modern-day slavery. These days, this exploitation is perpetuated by the corporations at the top of the food chain: supermarkets. Their buying power has kept wages pitifully low and has created a scenario where desperately poor people are willing to put up with anything to keep their jobs.	http://resizing.flixster.com/dLz_I07K9E_hZo2m8VcBvZx8YN4=/307x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/05/11180575_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/llDXsf_DrGyXqCi2JJ7pT4M50i8=/173x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/05/11180575_ori.jpg	Documentary, News	Sanjay Rawal	Erin Barnett, Sanjay Rawal	26 Apr 2014	03 Feb 2015	2014-11-21	2015-02-03	83 min	N/A	Eve Ensler, Barry Estabrook, Dolores Huerta, Robert Kennedy Jr.	90	food-chains	9.0	foodchains	9.0

It's a coming-of-age story, but this isn't an indie drama about a boy becoming a man. It's a comedy about Tony Phillips, a guy who doesn't think childhood passions should have an expiration date. This won't be teenage life as viewed from an adult's nostalgia-tinted rear view mirror. This is in every sense a teen's story told from the perspective of actual teenagers, both behind and in front of the camera. That means no hyper-meta dialogue, no larger-than-life scenarios, and no over-the-top style. This is all straight from Emily's heart.	http://resizing.flixster.com/i_-MHMkcbWeZ6wn00ECaRdoBc38=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/27/11172755_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/AdPg_4QYG_NlJK8t0vi44BjhsTQ=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/27/11172755_ori.jpg	Comedy	Emily Hagins	Emily Hagins	31 Oct 2013	29 Sep 2014	2013-10-31	2014-09-29	90 min	N/A	Trevon D.

1906	771362022	The French Minister	Alexandre Taillard de Vorms is tall and impressive, a man with style, attractive to women. He also happens to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the land of enlightenment: France. With his silver mane and tanned, athletic body, he stalks the world stage, from the floor of the United Nations in New York to the powder keg of Oubanga. There, he calls on the powerful and invokes the mighty to bring peace, to calm the trigger-happy, and to cement his aura of Nobel Peace Prize winner-in-waiting. Alexandre Taillard de Vorms is a force to be reckoned with, waging his own war backed up by the holy trinity of diplomatic concepts: legitimacy, lucidity and efficacy. He takes on American neo-cons, corrupt Russians and money-grabbing Chinese. Perhaps the world doesn't deserve France's magnanimousness, but his art would be wasted if just restricted to home turf. Enter the young Arthur Vlaminck, graduate of the elite National School of Administration, who is hired as head of "language" at the foreign ministry. In other words, he is to write the minister's speeches. But he also has to learn to deal with the sensibilities of the boss and his entourage, and find his way between the private secretary and the special advisers who stalk the corridors of the Quai d'Orsay - the ministry's home - where stress, ambition and dirty dealing are the daily currency. But just as he thinks he can influence the fate of the world, everything seems threatened by the inertia of the technocrats.	http://resizing.flixster.com/fKF7rIaz2zvASB01K7Y3BrcQ0WQ=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/69/11176933_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/gnQkTjadP-U4p3-QFvzV105MFac=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/69/11176933_ori.jpg	Comedy	Bertrand Tavernier	Christophe Blain, Abel Lanzac	06 Nov 2013	28 Jul 2014	2014-03-21	2014-07-28	113 min	$3.8k	Thierry Lhermitte, Raphaël Personnaz, Niels Arestrup, Bruno Raffaelli	65	the-french-minister	6.5	thefrenchminister	6.5

She shares a small apartment with two Siamese cats and her rich collection of great literature. She maintains no close personal relationships aside from those she has with her favorite authors and stories. Her life is far less complicated than the dramas she devours on the page, and she likes it that way. But Linda's simple life turns an unexpected page when former star pupil Jason Sherwood (Michael Angarano) returns to Kingston after trying to make it as a playwright in New York. Now in his 20s, Jason is on the verge of abandoning art, pressured by his overbearing father, Dr. Tom Sherwood (Greg Kinnear), to face reality and go to law school. Linda can't stand the thought of Jason giving up on his dreams so she decides to mount his play - a dark, angst-ridden, ambitious work - as a Kingston High School production, with flamboyant drama teacher Carl Kapinas (Nathan Lane) directing. As Linda, now well out of her normal comfort zone, takes further risks in life and love, the stage is set for highly comic downfall. With the play, her reputation, and her teaching career on the line, Linda finds an unlikely ally in herself.

841	771364779	The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came To Eden	Darwin meets Hitchcock in this feature-length documentary. THE GALAPAGOS AFFAIR is a gripping tale of idealistic dreams gone awry, set in the brutal yet alluring landscape of the Galapagos Islands. Featuring voice-over performances by Cate Blanchett, Diane Kruger, Connie Nielsen, Sebastian Koch, Thomas Kretschmann, Gustaf Skarsgard and Josh Radnor, this film skillfully interweaves an unsolved 1930s murder mystery with stories of present day Galapagos pioneers (a handful of Europeans, Americans and Ecuadoreans who settled idiosyncratically on the Islands between the 1930s and 1960s). As such, it is a parable about the search for paradise -- about what happens when a handful of individualists settle on the same small island seeking their own distinct and sometimes clashing notions of Eden.	http://resizing.flixster.com/BaaaoHa0D93Ey77vF0oqaIOvmgE=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/59/11175904_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/1WwM8IoQMimVDpne08BF7g_We28=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/59/11175904_ori.jpg	Documentary, Biography, Crime	Daniel Geller, Dayna Goldfine	Dayna Goldfine, Daniel Geller, Celeste Schaefer Snyder, Dore Strauch (from the books,  journals,  articles and letters of), Margret Wittmer (from the books,  journals,  articles and letters of), Friedrich Ritter (from the books,  journals,  articles and letters of), Hinz Wittmer (from the books,  journals,  articles and letters of), John Garth (from the books,  journals,  articles and letters of)	25 Jul 2014	09 Sep 2014	2014-04-04	2014-09-09	120 min	$0.2M	Cate Blanchett, Sebastian Koch, Thomas Kretschmann, Diane Kruger	82	the-galapagos-affair-satan-came-to-eden	8.2	thegalapagosaffairsatancametoeden	8.2

But their joy is quickly tempered by a sobering realization; how could they give these children any kind of a life beyond the desperate poverty that haunted many families in the midst of the Great Depression? When evangelist Reece Wade (Ray Liotta) reveals that he and his wife Louise (Ashley Judd) cannot have children, William feels the Lord's prompting to give them one of the infant boys. Both brothers are born with passion, drive and awesome musical talent, but take very separate, yet converging paths. Drexel Hemsley (Blake Rayne) rises like a comet and changes the music world forever. His adopted brother, Ryan Wade (also played by Blake Rayne) struggles to find the purpose for his life. All the way into manhood he wrestles with pleasing Reverend Wade, his loving but controlling father, who is convinced his son Ryan is called into the ministry. Ryan is encouraged by his loving and supportive wife Jenny (Erin Cottrell) and lifelong friends Dino and Avi (Seth Green, Joe Pantoliano) to follow his musical dreams. And oh, can he sing, just like his world famous twin! "The Identical" is a captivating journey spanning five decades from the 1930's through the 1970's.

1091	771380194	GreasePaint	GreasePaint is a documentary film by Daniel Espeut that follows Joey Thurmond and his family as they travel around the country performing the art of American circus clowning. The movie resurrects the dying art of clowning demonstrated by Joey's love for the craft and makes sure that people see the human side of clowning. While the over-arching story focuses on Joey and his ability to balance the business and family life, the viewer also hears from circus performers, old and new, discussing the positive and negative connotations that people have of clowns. Having started the clowning full time, Joey Thurmond has put his life savings and police pension into his ultimate passion. He overhauls the new show completely with a new background, traveling set, and living quarters. The family starts the year not knowing whether they will have enough money to make it back home from the road. His wife, Jamie, manages a lot of the day to day affairs and keeps the peace in the family. Joey's son, Tyler, weighs his options of staying with the business or pursuing his own dreams. Hernan Colonia, a late-comer to the show works on adjusting to his new surroundings and unfortunate immigration situation. The movie is a glimpse into a year of traveling in the most significant and dynamic year in the business' history while examining the clowning world as a whole. The audience sees the backstories of quite a few of the characters including Joey's rise from professional wrestler, to police officer, to clown. It is about the love of a family and how they manage to live and work together 24 hours a day while following their circus dreams.	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	Documentary, Comedy, Drama	Daniel Espeut	N/A	N/A	01 Jul 2014	2013-08-01	2014-07-01	84 min	N/A	Joey Thurmond, Jamie Thurmond, Tyler Thurmond, Hernan Colonia	\N	greasepaint	0.0	greasepaint	0.0

As Beckett finds himself further intertwined in their lives, he inadvertently helps Faye realize the depth of her family's problem, even as he brings a touch of happiness.

409	771385624	Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2	What began as the story of one man, is now a story about millions. After the film "Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead" documented his 60 day juice fast, Joe Cross vowed never to go on camera again. Since then, more than 20 million people have seen the film and Joe realized there's still a lot for him to learn about becoming healthy and staying that way. "Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead 2" taps into the tsunami of positive change that's sweeping the world when it comes to what we eat. As Joe sets out to learn how to be healthy in an unhealthy world, he talks to a wide range of experts, follows up with folks from the first film, and connects with new people along the way. Each one helps Joe learn that healthy eating is only one aspect of living a healthy life. From stay-at-home moms to world-class surgeons to office workers in Kenya, it seems like everyone is trying to be healthier, yet struggling to do so. While on the road, Joe experiences some ups and downs when it comes to managing his own weight. Joe's food battles resemble those of the everyday people he meets on his journey. Mirroring Joe's story is a series of testimonial videos submitted by people who saw the first film; their personal, intimate and often funny stories show that wanting to change is often easier than actually doing so. Top cardiologist Dean Ornish catches Joe by surprise when he explains that community is one of the most powerful forces in shaping a person's health. Joe finds out how true this really is when he catches up with Phil Staples, the truck-driver from the first film. Five years on, Phil is his own journey with varying levels of support and is dealing with his own set of ups and downs. It's Phil's experience that shows Joe just how big of an impact community can have. Through Joe's journey and the lives of the people he meets, Joe shows us in Fat Sick & Nearly Dead 2 that most people really do have control over of their health, even if they never knew it was possible. And that the final decision about what to put in your mouth, is what Joe calls, "The last two feet of freedom."	http://resizing.flixster.com/phVVZ5foptzYO_xgJyANzmX-89o=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/88/11188848_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/UgJu1O_8y0N2bCh2uYcGJUrXz5A=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/88/11188848_ori.jpg	Documentary	Kurt Engfehr	Joe Cross, Kurt Engfehr, Sean Frechette	18 Mar 2015	N/A	2014-09-18	2015-01-19	88 min	N/A	Joe Cross, Bjarke de Koning, Phil Staples	\N	fat-sick-and-nearly-dead-2	0.0	fatsickandnearlydead2	0.0

271	771369431	Web Junkie	The Chinese government is the first to classify internet addiction as a clinical disorder. 'Web Junkie' identifies internet addiction and focuses on the treatment used in Chinese rehabilitation centres. The film delves into a Beijing treatment centre and explores the cases of three adolescents from the day they arrive at the treatment centre through the three-month period of being held at the centre, and then their return to their homes. The film follows both the underlying issues related to the disorders, as well as the manner and treatment the patients receive. Professor Tao Ran established the world's first internet addiction clinic, and he promises to cure children of so-called internet addiction, which has grown into one of China's most feared public health hazards. The program admits children between the ages of 13 and 18 years; they are forced to undergo military-inspired physical training and comply with monitored sleep and food standards. Throughout their stay at the clinic, they are patrolled by the military guards who protect the children's quarters, which, like prisons, are surrounded by gates and fences. Despite such conditions, parents voluntarily send their children to the treatment centre and relinquish personal involvement. There is no one-on-one therapy, and the children's psychological needs are 'met' with group therapy sessions twice a week. The treatment is very expensive, and parents often borrow money in order to afford to send their child to the clinic. For them it is worth it - steering their child away from this addiction and redeveloping direct communication skills takes priority. 'Web Junkie' provides a microcosm of modern Chinese life, examines intergenerational pressures, and takes a hard look at one of the symptoms of the internet age.	http://resizing.flixster.com/E3tj42VGu6q5Sk_pxDSla-luGKc=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/92/11179231_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/pb_BK6a17p8sCyokMA5pO8R95gQ=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/92/11179231_ori.jpg	Documentary, Drama	Hilla Medalia, Shosh Shlam	Hilla Medalia (story), Hilla Medalia, Shosh Shlam (story), Shosh Shlam	01 Jan 2015	02 Mar 2015	2014-08-06	2015-03-02	74 min	N/A	N/A	68	web-junkie	6.8	webjunkie	6.8

His lawyer tells him it could jeopardize their case, especially since he can get a big settlement which he can use to pay back some people he borrowed from who "tell" him to pay or else.	http://resizing.flixster.com/-fMATP-O5lsI0LIkvtf9pSz58zE=/320x459/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/45/11174563_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/205nFZiC_wUph0R4jGAqogAyJoQ=/180x258/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/45/11174563_ori.jpg	Comedy, Drama	Ken Scott	Ken Scott (written for the screen by), Ken Scott (original screenplay "Starbuck"), Martin Petit (original screenplay "Starbuck")	22 Nov 2013	25 Mar 2014	2013-11-22	2014-03-25	105 min	$30.7M	Vince Vaughn, Chris Pratt, Cobie Smulders, Andrzej Blumenfeld	39	delivery-man	3.9	deliveryman	3.9

The country is in the throes of the Great Depression, the previous decade's boom of Italian, Irish, and Jewish immigrants has led to unprecedented urban expansion, and in the midst of an unseasonably warm autumn, steelworkers risk life and limb building skyscrapers high above the streets of Manhattan. In Men at Lunch, director Seán Ó Cualáin tells the story of "Lunch atop a Skyscraper," the iconic photograph taken during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza that depicts eleven workmen taking their lunch break while casually perched along a steel girder - boots dangling 850 feet above the sidewalk, Central Park and the misty Manhattan skyline stretching out behind them. For 80 years, the identity of the eleven men - and the photographer that Immortalized them - remained a mystery: their stories, lost in time, subsumed by the fame of the image itself. But then, at the start of the 21st century, the photograph finally began to give up some of its secrets. Part homage, part investigation, Men at Lunch is the sublime tale of an American icon, an unprecedented race to the sky and the immigrant workers that built New York.	http://resizing.flixster.com/YMJX5ufVzEDSsllc5Q0ECRBjGo0=/320x446/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/25/11172563_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/Nlot06Mg0aJY09hJ3xyr8v6c7b0=/180x251/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/25/11172563_ori.jpg	Documentary	Seán Ó Cualáin	N/A	01 Sep 2014	02 Dec 2013	2013-09-20	2013-12-02	75 min	$2.3k	Fionnula Flanagan, Peter Quinn, Ric Burns, Christine Roussel	42	men-at-lunch	4.2	menatlunch	4.2

The film is about an idea as well as a man - the idea of free expression as the defining characteristic of the individual.

She reports that her husband Henry and her son Peter have been eaten alive by a strong man. The eremite Talan Gwynek that lives in the woods with his mother is arrested by the police accused of being the killer. The defense attorney Kate Moore is assigned to defend Talan and she comes to the police station with her investigator Eric Sarin and the animal expert Gavin Flemyng to interview Talan. The unwilling police inspector Klaus Pistor is sure that Talan is the murderer but has to let Kate and her team work. There is turmoil in the precinct and Gavin is scratched by Talan. Then they visit Talan's mother Mrs. Gwynek and they learn that Talan has a rare disease. Further, the government wants her lands to dispose nuclear waste and her husband has recently died in car accident. Soon Eric discloses that the death of Mr. Gwynek was suspicious and Pistor was in charge of the investigation. When Kate succeeds in sending Talan to a hospital for examination, she discovers the effects of Talan's disease and is the responsible for the next events.	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	Horror, Mystery, Thriller	William Brent Bell	William Brent Bell (screenplay), Matthew Peterman (screenplay)	19 Aug 2014	23 Sep 2014	\N	2014-09-23	89 min	N/A	A.J.

His childhood guardian, Uncle Harry (a deliciously mean-spirited James Coco), refuses to give him a dime, and Henry, completely unwilling to exercise the only solution he sees--suicide-- devises a plan with the help of his imaginative butler: he can make money the old-fashioned way--he can marry it. With a temporary loan from Uncle Harry to tide him over, Henry has six weeks to find a bride, marry her, and repay the money, or else he must forfeit all his property to his uncle. With only days remaining, Henry meets clumsy, painfully shy heiress Henrietta Lowell (played by director Elaine May). She's the answer to his prayers--if only Henry can overcome the obstacles placed in his path by Uncle Harry, Henrietta's lawyer, and Henry's own reluctance to wed.	http://resizing.flixster.com/lMW4FsQLu-bCTlJ6j0ooHfSuKLk=/144x260/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/87/03/10870390_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/lMW4FsQLu-bCTlJ6j0ooHfSuKLk=/144x260/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/87/03/10870390_ori.jpg	Comedy, Romance	Elaine May	Elaine May, Jack Ritchie (story)	19 Jul 1971	23 Apr 2014	1971-03-11	2014-04-23	102 min	N/A	Walter Matthau, Elaine May, Jack Weston, George Rose	100	a-new-leaf	10.0	anewleaf	10.0
521	771360182	Sand Wars	After fresh water, sand is the most consumed natural resource on the planet. As a logical consequence of this exploitation, sand's limited reserves are threatened today. "Sand wars," triggered by building booms, are raging everywhere in the world and 3/4 of the planet's beaches are in decline and bound to disappear, victims of erosion and - as hard it might be to comprehend - smuggling. Most of us see sand as a free material, a staple of holidays spent on the shore, in unlimited supply. Sand is everywhere around us, be it beach, desert or town. Every house, every skyscraper with a dazzling glass front, all our bridges, airports and sidewalks - are basically made of sand. We use it as well to make fiber optic cable, mobile phone components and computer chips. We even slip some into our toothpaste, our powered food, our glass of wine. But is this omnipresent material inexhaustible? Can the available quantity match an ever-increasing demand that is constantly fed by the need for human lodging and expansion? What will be the consequences of intensive sand extraction on the environment and life on the planet? In tracking sand's "new" smugglers, corrupt politicians, unscrupulous property developers, and the ecologists trying to halt the erosion and disappearance of beaches, this investigation will take us around the world to witness this new gold rush firsthand. The "sand wars" has started. Who is ready to lead?	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	Documentary	Denis Delestrac	Denis Delestrac	19 Oct 2013	02 Dec 2014	\N	2014-12-02	74 min	N/A	Sumaira Abdulali, George Borden, Eric Chaumillon, Loke Ming Chou	\N	sand-wars	0.0	sandwars	0.0

Charles Xavier and his X-Men try their best to deal with the Sentinels but they are able to adapt and deal with all mutant abilities. Charles decides to go back in time and change things. He asks Kitty Pryde who can send a person's consciousness into the person's past to send him but she can only send someone back a few weeks because if she sends someone back further it could harm them. So Logan decides to go back himself because he might be able to withstand it. So Charles tells him that it's Mystique who's responsible because when she learned about the Sentinels she sought out Bolivar Trask the man who created them and killed him. She would be caught and studied and her ability to change was somehow added to the Sentinels which is why they can adapt. Logan must go to the younger Charles and ask him to help; problem is that he was despondent at that time and without his powers because he took a drug which allows him to walk but takes away his powers. Logan is also told to find Magneto.	http://resizing.flixster.com/KHyY7gNWwR9Fz4XeaTfAmlyBMe0=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/08/11180875_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/Oi1KcdBv_gG5Xqk84faEkayyX9E=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/08/11180875_ori.jpg	Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi	Bryan Singer	Simon Kinberg (screenplay), Jane Goldman (story), Simon Kinberg (story), Matthew Vaughn (story)	23 May 2014	14 Oct 2014	2014-05-23	2014-10-14	132 min	$233.9M	Hugh Jackman, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence	91	x-men-days-of-future-past	9.1	xmendaysoffuturepast	9.1

962	771315359	When I Saw You	1967. The world is alive with change: brimming with reawakened energy, new styles, music and an infectious sense of hope. In Jordan, a different kind of change is underway as tens of thousands of refugees pour across the border from Palestine. Having been separated from his father in the chaos of war, Tarek, 11, and his mother Ghaydaa, are amongst this latest wave of refugees. Placed in "temporary" refugee camps made up of tents and prefab houses until they would be able to return, they wait, like the generation before them who arrived in 1948. With difficulties adjusting to life in Harir camp and a longing to be reunited with his father, Tarek searches a way out, and discovers a new hope emerging with the times. Eventually his free spirit and curious nature lead him to a group of people on a journey that will change their lives. When I Saw You is the story of people affected by the times around them, in search of something more in their lives. A journey full of adventure, love, humor, and the desire to be free. A story of the human spirit that knows no borders.	http://resizing.flixster.com/QARYC6AW_BcmbYCaQO-U8lwlkUQ=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/77/11187759_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/bEJJ3JSqclQR1rsU_0Y7V_72l0M=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/77/11187759_ori.jpg	Drama	Annemarie Jacir	Annemarie Jacir (screenplay)	15 Jan 2014	18 Aug 2014	\N	2014-08-18	98 min	N/A	Mahmoud Asfa, Ruba Blal, Saleh Bakri, Anas Algaralleh	100	when-i-saw-you	10.0	whenisawyou	10.0
38	771401147	Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles	Magician: The Astonishing Life and Work of Orson Welles looks at the remarkable genius of Orson Welles on the eve of his centenary - the enigma of his career as a Hollywood star, a Hollywood director (for some a Hollywood failure), and a crucially important independent filmmaker. Orson Welles's life was magical: a musical prodigy at age 10, a director of Shakespeare at 14, a painter at 16, a star of stage and radio at 20, romances with some of the most beautiful women in the world, including Rita Hayworth. His work was similarly extraordinary, most notably Citizen Kane, (considered by many to be the most important movie ever made), created by Welles when he was only 25. In the years following Citizen Kane, Welles's career continued to change as he made film after film (some never finished, many dismissed) and acted in other projects often to earn money in order to keep making his own films. Magician features scenes from almost every existing Welles film, from Hearts of Age, (which he made in a day when he was only 18 years old) to rarely-seen clips from his final unfinished works like The Other Side of the Dream, The Deep, and Don Quixote, as well as his television and commercial work.	http://resizing.flixster.com/sh5kxw95nHVzkPpAmjbSiysHjzQ=/320x475/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/15/11181517_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/FU2rADTTTgbYfwvTai9HW15JLBQ=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/15/11181517_ori.jpg	Documentary	Chuck Workman	N/A	09 Nov 2014	26 May 2015	2014-12-10	2015-05-26	91 min	$15.5k	Peter Bogdanovich, Orson Welles	75	magician-the-astonishing-life-and-work-of-orson-welles	7.5	magiciantheastonishinglifeandworkoforsonwelles	7.5

The series draws together interviews with some of the world's leading intellectuals, journalists and activists to offer an alternative perspective on today's society and the future we're creating. We do not choose to exist, or the environment we grow up in. Our starting point in life is one of passive reliance on forces over which we have no control. THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH shows that from birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces: familial, educational, cultural, and professional. The outcome of this battle not only determines who we become, but the society that we create.	http://resizing.flixster.com/9V6XH2mtX-O2twCDf9sEONZMFjI=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/19/11171914_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/l79a2-ESsXj2pAtT2t8-mf30jBw=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/19/11171914_ori.jpg	Documentary, History	Raoul Martinez, Joshua van Praag	Raoul Martinez	21 Jun 2013	17 Feb 2014	2013-06-21	2014-02-17	77 min	N/A	Michael Albert, Stanley Aronowitz, Tony Benn, Nick Davies	\N	creating-freedom-the-lottery-of-birth	0.0	creatingfreedomthelotteryofbirth	0.0

1000	771371948	God's Not Dead	Radisson finds the topic of religion painful because his Christian mother died when he was 12, though he had prayed and begged God to spare her life. This may be what led him to study philosophy so in-depth that he ultimately became a philosophy professor, but his desire to now avoid the topic of religion does not mesh well with his career as a philosophy professor. His anger at God has him requesting his students quote Friedrich Nietzsche and, in exchange, he promises to allow them to skip the chapter on religion. This is not the only clue the movie makers give that they have read atheist material extensively. Radisson tells Josh that if he won't reach a consensus with the class, he must prove God is not dead. Radisson had already explained this was a metaphor and, taken in the context of Nietzsche's point, Josh does an excellent job of proving this. Radisson promises Josh that he will keep his comments to a minimum (Radisson won't debate Josh), though Josh begins his argument practically begging for the most common atheist argument when he says "I say you can't prove God does not exist". Radisson promised he would not debate Josh, and he keeps this promise. We are given more clues as to why when we discover Radisson married a Christian and his hostility towards God roots from his love for his Christian mother.	http://resizing.flixster.com/itmKYBlde6I1nNLMIcZQXy7reFw=/320x472/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/59/11175915_ori.png	http://resizing.flixster.com/AsJfjmUOl4kdMwOe7Rj08EH7ZTw=/180x266/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/59/11175915_ori.png	Drama	Harold Cronk	Hunter Dennis (story), Chuck Konzelman (story), Chuck Konzelman, Cary Solomon (story), Cary Solomon	21 Mar 2014	05 Aug 2014	2014-03-21	2014-08-05	113 min	$60.8M	Kevin Sorbo, Shane Harper, David A.R.

2052	771196654	Stories We Tell	In this inspired, genre-twisting new film, Oscar®-nominated writer/director Sarah Polley discovers that the truth depends on who's telling it. Polley is both filmmaker and detective as she investigates the secrets kept by a family of storytellers. She playfully interviews and interrogates a cast of characters of varying reliability, eliciting refreshingly candid, yet mostly contradictory, answers to the same questions. As each relates their version of the family mythology, present-day recollections shift into nostalgia-tinged glimpses of their mother, who departed too soon, leaving a trail of unanswered questions. Polley unravels the paradoxes to reveal the essence of family: always complicated, warmly messy and fiercely loving. Stories We Tell explores the elusive nature of truth and memory, but at its core is a deeply personal film about how our narratives shape and define us as individuals and families, all interconnecting to paint a profound, funny and poignant picture of the larger human story.	http://resizing.flixster.com/n4ZyDGcHEdJLnyryi93F94-RghI=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/07/11170747_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/ckHa8HEo39Aa2Yilpf87YCBfO9I=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/07/11170747_ori.jpg	Documentary	Sarah Polley	Sarah Polley, Michael Polley (narration)	17 Jan 2013	03 Sep 2013	2013-05-10	2013-09-03	108 min	$1.6M	Michael Polley, Harry Gulkin, Susy Buchan, John Buchan	94	stories-we-tell	9.4	storieswetell	9.4

Following the death of her maternal grandmother she hardly knew, Jessica reluctantly returns to the family home. She doesn't get along with her mother very well and is not looking forward to seeing her again. Upon her arrival, Jessica discovers that her late grandmother is lying in the adjoining room to her own during the wake. After a rough first night made restless by a strange nightmare in which she meets her dead grandmother, Jessica suddenly becomes ill. Stuck in bed with a high fever, the young woman decides to use her lethargic state to try out lucid dreaming. In order to do so, and on Sean's advice, Jessica breathes a little bit of ether whenever she needs to sink deeper into the other world to try and take control of her nightmares. Jessica then begins to wander in a nightmarish world inhabited by twisted versions of her family members. She gradually improves her skills as a lucid dreamer and investigates to solve the mystery that gnaws her and haunts the family home...	http://resizing.flixster.com/_Eb0KWU1D26037p9lSOwYs1bNm8=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/05/11190599_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/0sSj7bj5fNcsbAyKNec2CRRWDEo=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/05/11190599_ori.jpg	Fantasy, Horror	Romain Basset	Romain Basset, Karim Chériguène	11 Mar 2015	23 Jun 2015	\N	2015-06-23	89 min	N/A	Lilly-Fleur Pointeaux, Catriona MacColl, Murray Head, Gala Besson	\N	horsehead	0.0	horsehead	0.0

1334	771325265	Gloria	Mild mannered Jack Dawn has been secretly working as an accountant for the mob. He, his Puerto Rican wife Jeri, his teen-aged daughter Joan and his mother-in-law, all who were planning on going on the run, are murdered by the mob because Jack was going to inform on them to the FBI. Before they're killed, Jack and Jeri are able to send their six-year old son Phil to Jeri's friend and their neighbor, Gloria Swenson, for safe keeping. Also with Phil is the book which contains all the information Jack was going to turn over. Gloria and Phil have an antagonistic relationship, not so much for who they are but what they are, Phil a kid, and Gloria a strange white woman who hates kids. As an ex-mistress of a mobster, Gloria learns that the people that killed the Dawns are old friends of hers. As Gloria and Phil go on the run both from the mob and from the authorities (who believe she kidnapped Phil) throughout New York City, Gloria has to come up with a plan on how best to save themselves, which is not easy because of their love/hate relationship and the fact that precocious Phil has a mind of his own. That plan includes what to do with the book, but more importantly how to save Phil as the mob would still be after him regardless of the book just in case he knows something about his father's dealings. All through their ordeal, Gloria is not averse to shooting to kill, especially if those who she is trying to kill are trying to kill her and Phil first.	http://resizing.flixster.com/QGL_jXy5ptAgYznSkPorPyGVjfc=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/79/11187970_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/M69-Olpoy1-dywKwyaVQy2q7nTU=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/79/11187970_ori.jpg	Crime, Drama, Thriller	John Cassavetes	John Cassavetes	19 Sep 1980	25 Feb 2003	\N	2014-04-28	123 min	N/A	Julie Carmen, Tony Knesich, Gregory Cleghorne, Buck Henry	\N	gloria	0.0	gloria	0.0

185	771386065	One Million Dubliners	Glasnevin Cemetery is the final resting place of 1.5 million souls; it is Ireland's national necropolis. ONE MILLION DUBLINERS reveals the often unspoken stories of ritual, loss, redemption, emotion, history - and the business of death. But this is really a film about life: the Saint Valentine's Day rush in the florists; the American visitors eagerly searching for Irish ancestors; lost and longed for love; discovery and bereavement; earthy gravediggers and musicians in celebration. Above all, it's the story of an immensely engaging Tour Guide shepherding his charges - and us - through the headstones and monuments, through opinions and beliefs. Filled with the familiar and the fascinating, this is a documentary that offers a glimpse into the unknown, into a world we will all come to share. Often humorous, always affecting, ONE MILLION DUBLINERS explores life, death and the afterlife, and ends in a way that will stay with you forever. Even in a cemetery you never quite get used to death.	http://resizing.flixster.com/ty2r5xjUWWehYSAX4IgX1BQRJgk=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/99/11189916_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/VQN4REXWyuzdpNPsRj2gZxKLVoc=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/99/11189916_ori.jpg	Documentary, Drama, History	Aoife Kelleher	James Mitchell	31 Oct 2014	20 Apr 2015	\N	2015-04-20	80 min	N/A	N/A	\N	one-million-dubliners	0.0	onemilliondubliners	0.0

60	771382666	Last Hijack	LAST HIJACK is a true tale of survival in Somalia told from the pirate's perspective. Combining animation with documentary storytelling, the film takes an innovative hybrid approach to explore how one Somali pirate - Mohamed - came to live such a brutal and dangerous existence. Animated re-enactments exploring Mohamed's memories, dreams and fears from his point of view are juxtaposed with raw footage from his everyday life in an original non-fiction narrative. Somalia is the worldwide capital of piracy, and Mohamed is one of Somalia's most experienced pirates. But in his homeland, a failed state, Mohamed is just another middle-aged man trying to make ends meet. Far removed from the glamour and adventure of the pirates of books and movies, Somali pirates face increasing scrutiny and stigmatization both at home and abroad. Now Mohamed is engaged and both his parents and his in-laws pressure him to change his ways before the big wedding day. Mohamed senses that the golden age of piracy may be coming to an end, and with pressure mounting to provide for his loved ones, he must decide whether to risk everything for one last hijack.	http://resizing.flixster.com/WhnRQ6olXbEUHyPd6WbtcmJMXK0=/320x452/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/10/11181080_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/b0TaEUi1yZbv9GqVGk4Fa4g-i6A=/180x254/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/10/11181080_ori.jpg	Documentary, Animation	Tommy Pallotta, Femke Wolting	Tommy Pallotta, Femke Wolting	24 Apr 2014	18 May 2015	2014-10-03	2015-05-18	83 min	N/A	N/A	92	last-hijack	9.2	lasthijack	9.2

Winton, now 102 years old, did not speak about these events with anyone for more than half a century. His exploits would have probably been forgotten if his wife, fifty years later, hadn't found a suitcase in the attic, full of documents and transport plans. Today the story of this rescue is known all over the world. He was knighted by the Queen Elisabeth II and the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 583 recognizing his remarkable deed. Winton's story is a very emotional one, and thousands of children in many countries have decided to follow in his footsteps and do something important. They think up various charity projects and even help in the saving of lives of undernourished and sick children in Cambodia and Africa. 120,000 children in the Czech Republic signed a petition to award Nicholas Winton the Nobel Prize for Peace. Dozens of Winton's "children" have been found and to this day his family has grown to almost 6,000 people, many of whom have gone on to achieve great things themselves. It is incredible that all these people live due to the heroic deeds of one man - Sir Nicholas Winton.	http://resizing.flixster.com/s5Z1BziEPJAUWJ6pr-Pz9fsCPtM=/320x460/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/15/11171501_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/xeh7POfAnlJfNz4VinpboetnqUI=/180x259/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/15/11171501_ori.jpg	Documentary, Biography, Drama	Matej Minac	Matej Minac, Patrik Pass	01 Jan 2011	23 Jun 2014	2013-07-19	2014-06-23	96 min	N/A	Ben Abeles, Jirina Bohdalová, The Dalai Lama, Klára Issová	62	nickys-family	6.2	nickysfamily	6.2

1280	771376355	American Jesus	"American Jesus" is an exploration of Christianity in every faction of American Life, from the bread line to the yoga studio, from the humble churches of snake handlers to the mega churches of the ex-urbs. Christian cowboys, bikers and musicians, comedians, surfers and cage-fighters, they are all doing it for Christ. Aram Garriga travels from his native Barcelona to the politically divided United States to chronicle the sometimes bizarre relationship between faith, materialism, politics and personal passions in this uniquely American tableaux. Populated by an array of religious and secular characters offering candid, often illuminating testimonials, American Jesus is a vivid mosaic of personalities and conflicting points of view that emerges as a portrait of an America yearning for solace and meaning in the modern world.	http://resizing.flixster.com/0os6QuK5xIVJuOIa7UFQjILkWbQ=/320x453/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/79/11177977_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/QVD6y5DqFACJgjDEYPlSbqJ-2Cc=/180x255/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/79/11177977_ori.jpg	Documentary	Aram Garriga	Aram Garriga, Xavi Prat	04 Oct 2013	13 May 2014	2014-05-14	2014-05-13	80 min	N/A	Keenan Smith, Mara Einstein, Mickey Stonier, Douglas Rushkoff	57	american-jesus	5.7	americanjesus	5.7

1169	771372142	The Fabulous Ice Age	The era of the great American touring ice shows revealing how, with their dazzling production numbers and variety acts, they dominated family entertainment for decades. It also depicts one skater's quest to keep this history from being forgotten. The ice shows' creation and success changed the lives of skaters and audiences alike - eventually exporting American culture around the world. Rare archival footage, candid interviews with producers, skating legends and devoted chorus gypsies bring this never-before-told history of a uniquely American art form to life. The journey begins in 1915 when a young German skater, Berlin's Charlotte, brings her "ballet on ice" to New York's Hippodrome Theater, igniting America's love of theatrical skating. In 1936, Minnesotan brothers Roy and Eddie Shipstad and partner Oscar Johnson booked their skating troupe (which had been performing at local ice carnivals and hockey games) into a hotel tank show, thus laying the groundwork for America's first touring ice show, the "Ice Follies". Simultaneously, Olympic skating champion Sonja Henie took Hollywood by storm, resulting in the creation of The Hollywood Ice Revue, a lavish touring show starring Hollywood's newest sensation. Heniecontinued to make movie after movie, quickly becoming the highest paid star in Hollywood. As public interest soared, the Arena Managers Association created the Ice Capades, and soon "the big three" were performing year-round to packed houses. In 1945, Minnesotan Morris Chalfen bought into a fledgling company called Holiday on Ice and, with the creation of a portable ice system, brought the ice show touring business to a new level, enabling him to book his show into any-and-all venues. As a part of America's cultural exchange program, he sent Holiday on Ice throughout Europe and behind the Iron Curtain, eventually introducing ice shows to countries in Africa, Asia, and South America - exporting American culture and values through entertainment, even to places that had never seen ice. Meanwhile, inspired by Henie's films, and roller skating star Gloria Nord (Sonja Henie on wheels), a young Roy Blakey started amassing his ice show collection and dreamed of becoming a figure skater (a dream fulfilled when Roy began his skating career in a hotel tank show, eventually joining Holiday on Ice's international company during the 1960s). Since hanging up his skates, Blakey has become the unofficial archivist of theatrical skating, amassing a vast collection of posters, programs, photographs, films, costumes and souvenirs. Blakey's IceStage Archive holds the key to illustrating this amazing story of a century of performing on the frozen stage. Roy, his fellow skaters and the statesmen and women of the industry, recall an era when sequined costumes, beautiful music and big production numbers were an evening's entertainment for the entire family. Skating legends, including 1964 Olympic Champion Dick Button, help tell the story of a community who lived their dream by touring the globe on a stage of ice,when ice shows employed thousands who entertained millions worldwide. Scott Hamilton and Kenneth Feld, producers of Stars on Ice and Disney on Ice, respectively, speak about the evolution of theatrical ice-skating into the ice shows of today. With never before seen footage, photos and rare archival material, "The Fabulous Ice Age" captures not only this glamorous and important live-entertainment history, but also a portrait of a sequestered family touring existence, living in the world on an international level, but not of it. Spanning several generations, this art form responded in its own way to social and political turmoil and historical events: The Cold War, racial integration and acceptance of sexual orientation. Yet through it all they were creating a magical world of the ice shows.	http://resizing.flixster.com/uA3ySj2AVE4bzt9DmTwA58uYPKo=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/83/11188353_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/-aY2_bwA1ZasD5JKFLzydXQmxJo=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/83/11188353_ori.jpg	Documentary	Keri Pickett	N/A	14 Apr 2013	16 Jun 2014	\N	2014-06-16	N/A	N/A	Stephanie Andros, Denise Benoit-Eby, Roy Blakey, Douglas Breniser	\N	the-fabulous-ice-age	0.0	thefabulousiceage	0.0

1729	771369590	Forward 13: Waking Up the American Dream	Caught in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, Patrick Lovell, one of 10 million people who lost their homes, finds himself asking why he and so many Americans were blindsided by the economy's implosion. How could his pursuit of the American Dream - starting a business, providing for his new family, and owning a home - drive him to financial ruin? Coinciding with the exponential growth of the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement, Lovell embarks on a cross-country journey to discover what happened to the America originally founded to be free from tyranny. Conversations with a broad spectrum of energy and political academics, OWS protestors, professional developers, real estate agents, and attorneys all lead to the same conclusion: the system is broken. FORWARD 13: WAKING UP THE AMERICAN DREAM provides a fresh, personal perspective on the mortgage crisis and its ties to big government and big oil/natural gas. And while the road to recovery is a long and difficult one, there are clear, sustainable methods to revive the American Dream.	http://resizing.flixster.com/YKWmRJ79k6iknt34EmnN3WxUrzA=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/83/11188322_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/wmGvZbcfpu03m_cs-TwyE5GoAuU=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/83/11188322_ori.jpg	Documentary, News	Patrick Lovell	N/A	21 Jan 2014	N/A	2014-01-21	2014-01-17	120 min	N/A	Patrick Lovell	\N	forward-13-waking-up-the-american-dream	0.0	forward13wakinguptheamericandream	0.0
1954	771360533	Dear Mom, Love Cher	Dear Mom, Love Cher provides a rare peek into Cher's fascinating family history and features in depth interviews with Georgia Holt, her daughters Cher and Georganne LaPiere Bartylak, and grandchildren Chaz Bono and Elijah Blue Allman. The documentary begins with Holt's humble beginnings in rural Arkansas, where she first dreamt of stardom as a little girl and continues through her six tumultuous marriages while pursuing a career among Hollywood's elite as a singer and actress. Holt endures a series of dramatic personal and professional triumphs and setbacks but survived and overcame the odds -- no matter the challenge - to successfully raise two loving daughters. One of the daughters would live out the dream Holt could never fulfill for herself and go on to become one of the world's biggest stars. Dear Mom, Love Cher includes unprecedented access to the family and features a never-before-heard duet performance with Holt and Cher, along with the long-lost recordings Holt taped more than three decades ago that Cher has re-mastered for commercial release later this year, making her mother's lifelong dream a reality.	http://resizing.flixster.com/A3RH-pLFHj_G9S6SZWNFMg9RYAw=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/81/11188165_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/2HjOC9-cmqG6IvOIuxAwYdCCsMA=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/81/11188165_ori.jpg	Documentary	P.

Together, they must band together to attempt to survive the end of the world, only for Jay to find that they are all too dumb and superficial to do it until they discover the only way out.	http://resizing.flixster.com/kqD310jIp0m1aCuIO9nMLvAKO8Y=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/36/11173666_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/sPdtswW9AgAi6DLRotRlv3X3yU4=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/36/11173666_ori.jpg	Comedy, Fantasy	Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen	Seth Rogen (screenplay), Evan Goldberg (screenplay), Seth Rogen (screen story), Evan Goldberg (screen story), Seth Rogen (short film "Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse"), Jason Stone (based on the short film "Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse" by), Evan Goldberg (short film "Jay and Seth vs. The Apocalypse")	12 Jun 2013	01 Oct 2013	2013-06-12	2013-10-01	107 min	$101.5M	James Franco, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel	83	this-is-the-end	8.3	thisistheend	8.3
2215	771324992	Dirty Wars	Dirty Wars follows investigative reporter Jeremy Scahill, author of the international bestseller Blackwater, into the hidden world of America's covert wars, from Afghanistan to Yemen, Somalia, and beyond. Part action film and part detective story, Dirty Wars is a gripping journey into one of the most important and underreported stories of our time. What begins as a report on a deadly U.S. night raid in a remote corner of Afghanistan quickly turns into a global investigation of the secretive and powerful Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). As Scahill digs deeper into the activities of JSOC, he is pulled into a world of covert operations unknown to the public and carried out across the globe by men who do not exist on paper and will never appear before Congress. In military jargon, JSOC teams "find, fix, and finish" their targets, who are selected through a secret process. No target is off limits for the "kill list," including U.S. citizens.	http://resizing.flixster.com/CHkq70NDIcqPar49Lf9QQr-sC9w=/320x475/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/13/11171365_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/7mvi23_lHozBdzblB58DjXlo_n0=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/13/11171365_ori.jpg	Documentary, Crime, Drama	Rick Rowley	David Riker, Jeremy Scahill	18 Oct 2013	15 Oct 2013	2013-06-07	2013-10-15	87 min	$0.4M	Nasser Al Aulaqi, Saleha Al Aulaqi, Muqbal Al Kazemi, Abdul Rahman Barman	85	dirty-wars	8.5	dirtywars	8.5

738	771316752	The Prosecution of an American President	Famed Charles Manson prosecutor and New York Times bestselling author Vincent Bugliosi makes the most powerful, explosive, and thought-provoking argument of his storied career. In "The Prosecution of an American President", Bugliosi presents a meticulously researched legal case that proves George W. Bush took our nation to war in Iraq under false pretenses and is therefore, under the law, guilty of murder for the deaths of 4,500 young American soldiers who fought and died there. Bush's unlawful war also cost the United States over a trillion dollars; alienated many of our allies; caused the deaths of over 100,000 innocent Iraqi men, women, and children; and pushed a previously tranquil nation into unending civil war, atrocities and chaos. As a prosecutor dedicated to seeking justice, Bugliosi delivers a non-partisan argument based on hard facts and pure objectivity. This searing indictment also outlines a legally credible pathway to holding our highest government officials accountable for their actions, thereby creating a framework for future occupants of the Oval Office. Ultimately, Bugliosi calls for the United States to return to the great nation it once was.	http://resizing.flixster.com/U4OPdk8-HDLJfPPE8w0yO3D8HSo=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166965_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/AdfnFAljNEDh1fMDrb5x0fq_Ybg=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166965_ori.jpg	Documentary	David J.

Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom. From the outside Anna's sister, Elsa looks poised, regal and reserved, but in reality, she lives in fear as she wrestles with a mighty secret-she was born with the power to create ice and snow. It's a beautiful ability, but also extremely dangerous. Haunted by the moment her magic nearly killed her younger sister Anna, Elsa has isolated herself, spending every waking minute trying to suppress her growing powers. Her mounting emotions trigger the magic, accidentally setting off an eternal winter that she can't stop. She fears she's becoming a monster and that no one, not even her sister, can help her.	http://resizing.flixster.com/JXSNJEaVhCvawYoVMc7VCFJgjrU=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/35/11173584_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/M3JgYWjuLaOPruIuhLfHA0GwmtY=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/35/11173584_ori.jpg	Animation, Adventure, Comedy	Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee	Jennifer Lee (screenplay), Hans Christian Andersen (inspired by the story "The Snow Queen" by), Chris Buck (story), Jennifer Lee (story), Shane Morris (story), Dean Wellins (additional story)	27 Nov 2013	18 Mar 2014	2013-11-27	2014-03-18	102 min	$400.7M	Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad	89	frozen	8.9	frozen	8.9

Here we get a rare glimpse behind the scenes into the real Champagne through six houses, from small independent producers to the illustrious houses of Gosset and Bollinger. In the vineyard, 2012 threatened to be 'the year of all our fears.' But most Champagne is not just the product of a specific year and its weather. Signature house styles are creations that happen behind closed doors and in the miles of cellars beneath Champagne. Pull back the curtain and see how the people of a cold, tough land with a grim history triumph in producing the drink of joy, seduction and celebration.	http://resizing.flixster.com/W3Im8SfeuKeJhk1JGpksLrrZc3k=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/97/11189760_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/AtguuTuN8Xl0VvikCZ8cgx4lEEg=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/97/11189760_ori.jpg	Documentary	David Kennard	David Kennard	06 Mar 2015	11 May 2015	2015-03-06	2015-05-11	82 min	N/A	Martine Saunier	\N	a-year-in-champagne	0.0	ayearinchampagne	0.0
430	771355144	The Expedition to the End of the World	A real adventure film - but in a very modern sense. On a three-mast schooner aboard with artists, scientists and ambitions worthy of Noah or Columbus, we set off towards the end of the world: in this case, the rapidly melting ice massifs in North-East Greenland. An epic journey where the brave sailors get acquainted with imaginary tent pitches, polar bear nightmares and entirely new species. But in their encounter with the new, unknown parts of our world, the crew - which ranges from the artists Tal R and Daniel Richter to the geologist Minik Rosing - addresses a number of questions of a fundamental, existential nature. Curiosity, great pathos and a liberating splash of humor come together in a film that is superbly orchestrated by the cinematic talent Daniel Dencik, who in one iconic image after another seduces us both far beyond and deep into the historical footnote that is humanity. A film that is both conceived and brought into life on a large scale, just like an old childhood dream realized in adult company.	http://resizing.flixster.com/O6SYZ_MJxLdP-JxbU3T4azEE-y0=/320x460/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/93/11179318_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/tu8LaumCj39tA3EKMvqwnUba35c=/180x259/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/93/11179318_ori.jpg	Documentary, Adventure, Comedy	Daniel Dencik	Daniel Dencik, Michael Haslund-Christensen, Janus Metz Pedersen	06 Feb 2013	12 Jan 2015	2014-08-20	2015-01-12	90 min	$33.4k	Per Bak Jensen, Jonas Bergsøe, Bo Elberling, Jens Fog Jensen	82	the-expedition-to-the-end-of-the-world	8.2	theexpeditiontotheendoftheworld	8.2

478	771388113	Altina	Altina Schinasi, (1907 - 1999), was a paradox. Simultaneously seductive and reserved, her sheltered upbringing was in sharp contrast to the bold sexuality of her artwork, and she created a fashion sensation in the 1930s with her design for Harlequin eyeglasses. Altina is an affecting, provocative, and richly informative documentary about an American trendsetter-a woman before her time. Free of academic constraints and confident in her keen intellect, she crafted fragments of her life into sculptures that defined her surreal and original world. Her whimsical art was also anchored in social issues: her film on George Grosz took on the Holocaust, earning her an Oscar nomination and winning her the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. She befriended Martin Luther King Jr. and supported his struggle. And during the Red Scare, she did not hesitate to hide John Berry-who was blacklisted for having directed a documentary on the Hollywood Ten-in her Beverly Hills home. As a sculptor, her most original creations were called "chairacters." Exuding Altina's unencumbered feminist sexuality, these large, almost life-size chairs and benches depicted lovers in passionate embrace or turning away from each other to express the absence of love.	http://resizing.flixster.com/Me_vk8-7_g8n1W80RXNazbn7TPk=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/04/11180484_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/0ayYBYHcXJ7sS2JZBmZtq4t1JYc=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/04/11180484_ori.jpg	Documentary	Peter Sanders	N/A	12 Sep 2014	16 Dec 2014	2014-09-12	2014-12-16	120 min	N/A	Camille Billops, Zoe Caldwell, Charles Carey, Amy Fine Collins	86	altina	8.6	altina	8.6

Few directors have single-handedly shaken up the film establishment like the godfather of indie, Richard Linklater. From the groundbreaking SLACKER to his innovative BOYHOOD, Linklater has just reached the 21-year mark and has unapologetically carved his signature into American pop culture. This compelling documentary takes you on a behind the scenes tour into Linklater's style, skills, and motivation via his friends, actors, and other directors. Get a raw and honest perspective on Richard through candid conversations with Ethan Hawke, Jack Black, Keanu Reeves, Billy Bob Thornton, Matthew McConaughey, Jason Reitman, Julie Delpy and others, and see their stories brought to life through hilarious animated sequences. For a guy who became famous for celebrating the cool and casual, Linklater emerges as a surprisingly strategic and visionary director who has already established a legacy and perfected a style that can't be denied.	http://resizing.flixster.com/3oRSiRjkcKlOm2RD1OALRMkZHyw=/301x446/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/07/11180751_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/VVuKLW_OUWTXceLzrozvrYqInrk=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/07/11180751_ori.jpg	Documentary, Biography	Michael Dunaway, Tara Wood	Michael Dunaway, Tara Wood	07 Nov 2014	12 Jan 2015	2014-11-07	2015-01-12	78 min	N/A	Joey Lauren Adams, Jack Black, Louis Black, Rebecca Campbell	40	21-years-richard-linklater	4.0	21yearsrichardlinklater	4.0

Today we face peak oil, climate change, loneliness and severe health issues due to our way of life. But why? The Danish architect and professor Jan Gehl has studied human behavior in cities through four decades. He has documented how modern cities repel human interaction, and argues that we can build cities in a way, which takes human needs for inclusion and intimacy into account. 'The Human Scale' meets thinkers, architects and urban planners across the globe.

1848	771365356	A Year In Burgundy	The film follows seven wine-making families in the Burgundy region of France through the course of a full year, and delves into the cultural and creative process of making wine, as well as its deep ties to the land. What lies within the rhythm of a year, from vines to grapes to wine? The film is in four season-sections, and plays out against that backdrop: spring showers, drought, heat wave, hail and storms, harvest moons and the damp cold of winter. Each vintage is a time capsule, a bottled piece of history of a very specific year, with its particular weather pattern, its crises and its triumphs. It all goes in, whether you want it to or not, and 2011 was full of drama.	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	Documentary, Drama, Family	David Kennard	David Kennard	05 Nov 2013	03 Dec 2013	\N	2013-12-03	91 min	N/A	N/A	\N	a-year-in-burgundy	0.0	ayearinburgundy	0.0

Starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette as Mason's parents and newcomer Lorelei Linklater as his sister Samantha, BOYHOOD charts the rocky terrain of childhood like no other film has before. Snapshots of adolescence from road trips and family dinners to birthdays and graduations and all the moments in between become transcendent, set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay's Yellow to Arcade Fire's Deep Blue. BOYHOOD is both a nostalgic time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.	http://resizing.flixster.com/HP7uq8eNRBI6PcMbNRoH7wYMwdQ=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/99/11189929_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/ifaoam3JT77rfcCpDA_zZK44Kow=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/99/11189929_ori.jpg	Drama	Richard Linklater	Richard Linklater	15 Aug 2014	06 Jan 2015	2014-07-11	2015-01-06	165 min	$25.4M	Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Elijah Smith, Lorelei Linklater	98	boyhood	9.8	boyhood	9.8

As Iris and Gilbert go on their quest throughout the train, they believe there is a conspiracy amongst many of the passengers against the validity of there being a Miss Froy. But if there is a conspiracy, Iris and Gilbert still have to find Miss Froy and find out why anyone would want to kidnap a middle aged English governess.	http://resizing.flixster.com/o1LphGCs-wcuLOYMYYtL5Zw_4p4=/320x479/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/29/11172977_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/GEWbSo2TaHEf7jG-vN2zo6kOWbo=/180x269/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/29/11172977_ori.jpg	Comedy, Mystery, Thriller	Alfred Hitchcock	Ethel Lina White (based upon the story: "The Wheel Spins" by), Sidney Gilliat (screen play), Frank Launder (screen play)	01 Nov 1938	09 Nov 2000	\N	2014-02-04	96 min	N/A	Margaret Lockwood, Michael Redgrave, Paul Lukas, Dame May Whitty	\N	the-lady-vanishes	0.0	theladyvanishes	0.0

When their promising Scottish rap act was branded "the rapping Proclaimers" by scornful A&Rs, friends Billy and Gavin reinvented themselves as LA homeboys. The real deal.

520	771362196	The Dark Matter of Love	ABOUT THE FILM Eleven year old Masha Kulabokhova is about to be adopted into fourteen year old Cami Diaz's family. Masha grew up in a Russian orphanage; Cami was born and raised in Wisconsin and has been the exclusive focus of her parents' love her whole life. The process of Masha becoming part of the Diaz family is going to change both girls forever. THE DARK MATTER OF LOVE follows Masha as she leaves Russia to spend her first year as part of the Diaz family, who have also adopted five year old twin boys Marcel and Vadim. When the reality of bonding with children who have grown up in institutions turns out to be more difficult than they ever imagined, the Diaz's hire two of the world's best developmental psychologists to help them build their new family - through science. Professor Emeritus at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Dr Robert Marvin, has spent a lifetime developing a world-renowned therapy program that draws upon the past 100 years of scientific discoveries in the field of parent child love. By connecting the Diaz's with his research, Dr Marvin believes that he can help them create an environment in which Masha, Marcel and Vadim can form supportive, loving relationships. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, THE DARK MATTER OF LOVE melds the story of the Diaz family learning to love, with rare archive footage of science experiments exploring parent child love. The science of love has an intriguing and dark past. Experiments on monkeys, birds and even human children have contributed to science's knowledge of love's inner workings. Director Sarah McCarthy fuses revealing footage of these experiments to the narrative, drawing audiences deeper into the dark matter of love and encouraging them to contemplate their own relationships through an unflinching, scientific lens.	http://resizing.flixster.com/EgP2qLJJmmY4Z5YZv8FnKrkLGW4=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/82/11188200_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/BsPVJjpRefKe1i2R54ZCTBN8-z0=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/82/11188200_ori.jpg	Documentary	Sarah McCarthy	N/A	01 Nov 2012	01 Dec 2014	\N	2014-12-01	93 min	N/A	N/A	\N	the-dark-matter-of-love	0.0	thedarkmatteroflove	0.0
1328	771260196	Bucksville	Abandoned by his mother at a young age, 25-year old Presley Alan French (Thomas Stroppel) has grown up in the shadow of his father and a small town, secret militia called The Lodge. Along with his cousins, he is committed for life to participate in the group's self-appointed mission of justice and capital punishment. Ignited by a deep sense of civic duty, The Lodge was initiated many years ago by Presley's father, uncle and other town leaders, when a local girl was murdered and the killer released unpunished. The group captured the man and executed him deep in the woods. Over the years, other executions have been carried out in the name of community service. The death of Presley's father leads him to examine his ever-increasing trepidations about the group's ideology. This is compounded by the discovery that his uncle, now the new chief, is forming ties with Militia for America Now, an umbrella group with an extremist Right Wing agenda funded by a charismatic multi-millionaire (Tom Berenger). Presley must decide whether to break all bonds to family or be immersed in killings that are now politically motivated. Eerie and beautiful, Bucksville is a genre-bending drama/thriller whose timely topics of ethics and the militia movement ring with universal relevance. It is also a film about love, loyalty, and the loss of innocence.	http://resizing.flixster.com/h1hbBXDNAZZwjOyafhY35AX3jPo=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/73/11177390_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/50SXfCuXdi4QRIx0UXYYfiN02ZM=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/73/11177390_ori.jpg	Drama, Thriller	Chel White	Laura McGie (screenplay), Chel White (screenplay)	15 Oct 2011	29 Apr 2014	\N	2014-04-29	N/A	N/A	Thomas Stroppel, Ted Rooney, David Bodin, Tom Berenger	\N	bucksville	0.0	bucksville	0.0

997	771381191	Decline Of An Empire	Katherine of Alexandria, brought up as a nomad and living in the desert, was aged just 11 when Emperor Maxentius saw her whilst out on patrol. Consumed by her beauty, impudence and uncanny talent for languages, he abducted the child, killing her family. The slaughter was witnessed by her young friend, Constantine, who would later become Emperor of the Western Roman Empire. He never lost hope of finding Katherine. As a young woman, Katherine refused to submit to Maxentius' offers of marriage and she continually denounced his brutal enforcement of pagan religion upon the masses. Still obsessed with her beauty, Maxentius brought Katherine before 50 of Rome's finest scholars in an open court in Alexandria, where she eloquently demolished their arguments. When Constantine learned of Katherine's whereabouts and imprisonment at the hands of Maxentius, he led his army from York in a desperate bid to save her.	http://resizing.flixster.com/JFAcb5i7q1eUYl_Qb0PQYlVNB_w=/175x239/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/97/11179799_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/JFAcb5i7q1eUYl_Qb0PQYlVNB_w=/175x239/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/97/11179799_ori.jpg	Biography, History	Michael Redwood	N/A	12 Aug 2014	N/A	\N	2014-08-11	110 min	N/A	Nicole Keniheart, Peter O'Toole, Joss Ackland, Steven Berkoff	\N	decline-of-an-empire	0.0	declineofanempire	0.0

1048	771382471	The Wipers Times	Just after the First World War Fred Roberts goes for a job as a newspaper journalist and tells the sub-editor how, in the trenches in 1916, he discovered a printing press in working order. Helped by ex-printer Sergeant Harris and with his friend Jack Pearson as his assistant, he sets up the Wipers Times - the name coming from the soldiers' pronunciation of the town Ypres. Despite disapproval from officious Colonel Howfield but with backing from sympathetic General Mitford they produce twenty-three issues of a satirical magazine - its articles represented on screen in black and white - which boosts morale and even gets mentioned in the Tatler. The press is destroyed by a German shell but another is found and the paper's title changed to fit in with wherever the regiment is deployed. Pearson and Roberts are both awarded gallantry medals but when Roberts is only offered the job of crossword compiler by the sub-editor he moves to Canada as a prospector while Pearson marries and opens a hotel in Argentina. Both survived into the 1960s.	http://resizing.flixster.com/rkdTdkOdKtxFv9Cg8WCrhJG_mPg=/214x317/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/87/11178754_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/uSEwcBkWErh27BFCLKeIoJJ3OpU=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/87/11178754_ori.jpg	War	Andy De Emmony	Ian Hislop, Nick Newman	11 Sep 2013	N/A	\N	2014-07-15	92 min	N/A	Ben Chaplin, Patrick FitzSymons, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Steve Oram	\N	the-wipers-times	0.0	thewiperstimes	0.0

After fighting his way out of a building filled with gangsters and madmen - a fight that left the bodies of police and gangsters alike piled in the halls - rookie Jakarta cop Rama thought it was done and he could resume a normal life. He couldn't have been more wrong. Formidable though they may have been, Rama's opponents in that fateful building were nothing more than small fish swimming in a pond much larger than he ever dreamed possible. And his triumph over the small fry has attracted the attention of the predators farther up the food chain. His family at risk, Rama has only one choice to protect his infant son and wife: He must go undercover to enter the criminal underworld himself and climb through the hierarchy of competing forces until it leads him to the corrupt politicians and police pulling the strings at the top of the heap. And so Rama begins a new odyssey of violence, a journey that will force him to set aside his own life and history and take on a new identity as the violent offender "Yuda." In prison he must gain the confidence of Uco - the son of a prominent gang kingpin - to join the gang himself, laying his own life on the line in a desperate all-or-nothing gambit to bring the whole rotten enterprise to an end.	http://resizing.flixster.com/qitA9Zy1UJTmBI7T59IE7h57Ufw=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/92/11179238_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/kHto7CjjPJnfUyAZLubD3NXPtEs=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/92/11179238_ori.jpg	Action, Crime, Thriller	Gareth Evans	Gareth Evans	11 Apr 2014	08 Jul 2014	2014-03-28	2014-07-08	150 min	$2.6M	Iko Uwais, Arifin Putra, Tio Pakusodewo, Oka Antara	79	the-raid-2	7.9	theraid2	7.9

77	771378202	Champs	This epic story of the rise of three of the most successful boxers of our time challenges the perception of the American Dream through the intimately personal life trajectories of Evander Holyfield, Bernard Hopkins and Mike Tyson. Much like modern day gladiators, our protagonists come from the bottom rungs of society, choosing the path of boxing or "the poor man's sport," as a last resort, and an alternative to much bleaker options such as prison or, worse yet, death. Following these fighters' paths from success to self-discovery, they recount their battles while illuminating our country's most critical social issues, including the struggle with poverty, racial inequality, broken homes, drug and alcohol abuse, violence and the failures of our educational and prison systems. CHAMPS unearths the unique resilience of these men in the face of life's most difficult obstacles - from personal finance to sustained brain injury - and highlights how our society and their industry exalts their fleeting success, but leaves them without the skills, protections, medical care and training that they need to succeed outside of the ring. We call them "champs" in sport, but cannot help but ask whether they can truly be champions in life.	http://resizing.flixster.com/yf1Ge-unk7QqbN9Hbl5ojZhBuDY=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/03/11190351_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/hkwpVVvqfR7GsHdhvRsknsdV67s=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/03/11190351_ori.jpg	Documentary, Sport	Bert Marcus	Bert Marcus	13 Mar 2015	11 May 2015	2015-03-13	2015-05-11	N/A	N/A	Evander Holyfield, Bernard Hopkins, Mike Tyson, Larry 'Ratso' Sloman	56	champs	5.6	champs	5.6

404	770682755	My Winnipeg	Filmmaker Guy Maddin was born, raised and has always lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba, a town where he says everyone sleepwalks through life. He is trying to escape Winnipeg, but isn't sure how as he isn't sure what's kept him there in the first place. Perhaps his parent's month long 65th wedding anniversary celebration (despite his father being dead for some years) where he will reenact his childhood (with actors playing his family, except his mother who plays herself) in the old family home at 800 Ellis Avenue, which was above the family's hair salon business, will provide some answers. He recounts some civic events which have affected him and the life of Winnipegers: the 1919 general strike, the destruction of the Wolseley Elm in 1957, and the replacement of the iconic Eaton's building for the new hockey arena in favor of the old Winnipeg Arena. The latter has an especially close connection to him because of a family tie and the rich history of hockey in the city (discounting what he considers the failure of the NHL experiment). As he is on the train leaving the city, he hopes that the page 3 "Citizen Girl" will be the panacea for all Winnipeg's issues.	http://resizing.flixster.com/s_wShMZ4sMSpB9wJ-R-7D6266O8=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/94/11169421_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/GseuRhwvLyVCoaV7zvO7pIHNkrs=/180x266/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/94/11169421_ori.jpg	Documentary, Comedy, Drama	Guy Maddin	Guy Maddin, George Toles (dialogue writer)	04 Jul 2008	20 Jan 2015	2007-09-07	2015-01-20	80 min	N/A	Ann Savage, Louis Negin, Amy Stewart, Darcy Fehr	94	my-winnipeg	9.4	mywinnipeg	9.4

With the help of Dr. Cameron McCarthy, who developed a unique prosthetic tail for the injured dolphin, they were able to save her life. Yet their fight is not over. Winter's surrogate mother, the very elderly dolphin Panama, has passed away, leaving Winter without the only poolmate she has ever known. However, the loss of Panama may have even greater repercussions for Winter, who, according to USDA regulations, cannot be housed alone, as dolphins' social behavior requires them to be paired with other dolphins. Time is running out to find a companion for her before the team at Clearwater loses their beloved Winter to another aquarium.	http://resizing.flixster.com/fpOZkwLLwU5yR5dvqtVuEiHWwrs=/320x475/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/86/11178687_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/J0Ewu0p5c3qWj2ORDIMuBe_S6Cs=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/86/11178687_ori.jpg	Drama, Family	Charles Martin Smith	Charles Martin Smith, Karen Janszen (characters), Noam Dromi (characters)	12 Sep 2014	09 Dec 2014	2014-09-12	2014-12-09	107 min	$42.0M	Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Harry Connick Jr., Nathan Gamble	67	dolphin-tale-2	6.7	dolphintale2	6.7

1821	771324975	Big Sur	Sudden fame and a self-destructive lifestyle were taking a toll on Jack Kerouac's mind and body following the unparalleled success of the groundbreaking novel, On The Road. Once the handsome literary maverick and hero of the Beat Generation, Kerouac now sees only a vestige of his former self, ravaged by alcohol and drugs, aged beyond his years and tormented by self-doubt. Questioning his talent, his faith, and his mortality, Kerouac leaves New York for California, on a quest for redemption at an isolated, fog-banked cabin in the primitive landscape of the Big Sur woods. What ensues in those fateful 3 weeks of August, 1960, is both terrifying and revelatory. While Kerouac is able to find beauty and elation in his surroundings, the dichotomy of his psyche renders him unable to face his demons alone. He sets off on a visceral collision course of paranoia, sex, delirium tremens, misery and madness. His desperation culminates in an intense, hallucinatory breakdown, but the duality of his nature (again) comes into play and he emerges from his dark place - however fleeting - with a modicum of peace and optimism.	http://resizing.flixster.com/DXgNysBMIAj7GuiTu4cv0IHYfZI=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/36/11173622_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/hEPl_Hr0zRVZFzF4bC9lyiGouHE=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/36/11173622_ori.jpg	Drama	Michael Polish	Jack Kerouac (novel), Michael Polish (screenplay)	01 Nov 2013	14 Jan 2014	2013-11-01	2014-01-14	81 min	$35.9k	Jean-Marc Barr, Kate Bosworth, Josh Lucas, Anthony Edwards	45	big-sur	4.5	bigsur	4.5

Because of changing times and regulations, they are no longer able to make a living from their small coastal New Brunswick farm. And Irene has begun to show signs of early dementia. Against the wishes of their two offspring who still reside in the area and who would like to see more standard care provided for Irene, Craig, the son of a master shipbuilder who inherited his father's building abilities, decides to mill lumber from trees on their property and with it build a more suitable, small one story house on the property in which he and Irene can live. Beginning this project with only a design in his mind, he is encouraged by friends at least to go through the regulatory process of building permits and the like. Despite being able to complete this project to more than exacting centuries old standards, Craig ends up hitting one roadblock after another in this regulatory process, which could kibosh this project, and his want for what he sees as a comfortable life with Irene in their final years.	http://resizing.flixster.com/Um9Rr2ap105NMIeDsGxDcVdH5Mw=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/76/11177653_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/gBowJfvHS-QrpP8AbjpF9XHrcqg=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/76/11177653_ori.jpg	Drama	Michael McGowan	Michael McGowan	06 Jun 2013	06 May 2014	2013-07-12	2014-05-06	102 min	$1.2M	James Cromwell, Chuck Shamata, Geneviève Bujold, Ronan Rees	93	still-mine	9.3	stillmine	9.3
572	771324297	Stolen Seas	Stolen Seas presents a chilling exploration of the Somali pirate phenomenon and forces you to rethink everything you thought you knew about pirates. It's November 8th, 2008 and the CEC Future, a Danish-owned merchant ship, is on high alert. Sailing inside the pirate-infested swath of sea between Somalia and Yemen, the ship's captain blinks hard at the radar screen where a light begins to flash. This is it, Nozhkin thinks, and he's right. Machine guns sound on the boat's hull and for two months this 13-man crew will be held at the mercy of Somali pirates, helpless as hostage negotiations threaten their lives and cameras capture every move. The pirates' translator, Ishmael Ali, a single dad who may or may not have stumbled into this controversial role, puts in a call to the shipping magnate's CEO Per Gullestrup demanding an exorbitant 7 million dollars. The shipowner's response is the first of many misfires and communications to come. These two adversaries will have to become unlikely allies as they race against time in an attempt to keep the crew from being killed by their violent captors. Stolen Seas documents the story of 13 powerless men trapped on a ship, and why their captors feel justified in their tyranny. It's the story of a Somali translator who get's in over his head -trying to give his son a chance. With first hand accounts from leading experts on the subject refuting the common misconceptions, Stolen Seas explores theories of what drives a country to piracy, from every point of view. It is a film about a country on the brink, at the mercy of global capitalism in overdrive, and young boys with nothing to loose.	http://resizing.flixster.com/VHaIIpm5hzdLfYI-3wF75SwO4Hs=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168642_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/aPhA6upgeZt6lLD2gAdLU66RLDM=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/86/11168642_ori.jpg	Documentary, Adventure, Crime	Thymaya Payne	Mark Monroe	18 Jan 2013	13 Nov 2014	2013-01-18	2014-11-13	90 min	N/A	N/A	100	stolen-seas	10.0	stolenseas	10.0

372	771325068	Valentine Road	On February 12, 2008, in Oxnard, California, eighth-grade student Brandon McInerney shot his classmate Larry King twice in the back of the head during first period. When Larry died two days later, his murder shocked the nation. Was this a hate crime, one perpetrated by a budding neo-Nazi whose masculinity was threatened by an effeminate gay kid who may have had a crush on him? Or was there even more to it? Looking beyond all the copious news coverage of this tragic event, Valentine Road tells the story of two victims: the deceased and the murderer. With keen insight, the film connects the human wreckage of Larry's and Brandon's troubled lives-both physically abused, both from broken homes, and both searching for a sense of belonging.	http://resizing.flixster.com/3lftKA5EMJ4EFbGZRwchqG8ZVs4=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/60/11176095_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/GnP9BcNocgz4_YRiAmylUb7cA4w=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/60/11176095_ori.jpg	Documentary	Marta Cunningham	N/A	04 Oct 2013	02 Feb 2015	\N	2015-02-02	89 min	N/A	James Bing, Jeremy Bing, Rosalie Black, Dawn Boldrin	90	valentine-road	9.0	valentineroad	9.0

1927	771315443	Hannah Arendt	In 1961, the noted German-American philosopher, Hanna Arendt, gets to report on the trial of the notorious Nazi war-criminal, Adolf Eichmann. While observing the legal proceedings, the Holocaust survivor concludes that Eichmann was not a simple monster, but an ordinary man who thoughtlessly buried his conscience through his obedience to the Nazi Regime and its ideology. Arendt's expansion of this idea through her resulting New Yorker articles would create the concept of the "Banality of Evil" that she thought even sucked in some Jewish leaders of the era into unwittingly participating in the Holocaust. The result is a bitter public controversy in which Arendt is accused of blaming the Holocaust's victims. Now, that strong willed intellectual is forced to defend her daringly innovative ideas about moral complexity in a struggle that will exact a heavy personal cost.	http://resizing.flixster.com/Wtexa9digxgALY37bF51rrbSaGs=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/14/11171404_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/VC-cM5Zx_kUp51vQw1yma951U60=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/14/11171404_ori.jpg	Biography, Drama	Margarethe von Trotta	Pamela Katz (screenplay), Margarethe von Trotta (screenplay), Pamela Katz	10 Jan 2013	19 Nov 2013	2013-05-29	2013-11-19	113 min	$0.7M	Barbara Sukowa, Janet McTeer, Julia Jentsch, Axel Milberg	88	hannah-arendt	8.8	hannaharendt	8.8
382	771351199	The Color of Time	The Color of Time is based on Pulitzer prize-winning poet CK Williams' collection of the same name. The film blends together adaptations of 11 of the poems to create a poetic road trip through CK William's life. The film takes us on a journey through several decades of American life from CK's childhood and adolescence in Detroit in the 1940s and 50s to the early 1980s: CK and his wife Catherine are married with their son Jed. CK prepares for a reading of 'Tar' in New York City, and spends his nights struggling to write new poems, haunted by memories of his past. As CK drives to his reading in New York City, he remembers central moments of his life: we come to experience and understand both his relationship to love and loss, and how he found his calling as a poet through the women in his life. The film takes us back and forth between past and present, punctuated by voice-over from CK Williams' poems, recreating the experience of memory and exploring how the fragments of one's man life can be turned into poetic expression: his loving relationship to his mother, his first sexual experiences as a teenager, his first love and the struggle to preserve a form of innocence and wonder, the illness and loss of a close friend, and finally his life together with Catherine.	http://resizing.flixster.com/jJ_Grgul5qSlhLImJD4_hSWiLrs=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/17/11181702_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/sgB4GJuZdqHSHRH9dE5D84DRZ2Y=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/17/11181702_ori.jpg	Biography, Drama, Romance	Edna Luise Biesold, Sarah-Violet Bliss, Gabrielle Demeestere, Alexis Gambis, Brooke Goldfinch, Shripriya Mahesh, Pamela Romanowsky, Bruce Thierry Cheung, Tine Thomasen, Virginia Urreiztieta, Omar Zúñiga Hidalgo	Edna Luise Biesold, Sarah-Violet Bliss, Gabrielle Demeestere, Alexis Gambis, Shruti Ganguly, Brooke Goldfinch, Shripriya Mahesh, Pamela Romanowsky, Bruce Thierry Cheung, Tine Thomasen, Virginia Urreiztieta, Omar Zúñiga Hidalgo	09 Dec 2014	27 Jan 2015	2014-12-12	2015-01-27	73 min	N/A	James Franco, Mila Kunis, Jessica Chastain, Zach Braff	6	the-color-of-time	0.6	thecoloroftime	0.6

1643	771312195	About Time	At the age of 21, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) discovers he can travel in time... The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. But as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds out that his unique gift can't save him from the sorrows and ups and downs that affect all families, everywhere. There are great limits to what time travel can achieve, and it can be dangerous too.	http://resizing.flixster.com/KQTi5WTg8yZshr85AoN3oRyCbA0=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/53/11175398_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/rSycR7UUnBzT5RLJGaqB8etfsKg=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/53/11175398_ori.jpg	Drama, Fantasy, Romance	Richard Curtis	Richard Curtis	08 Nov 2013	04 Feb 2014	2013-11-01	2014-02-04	123 min	$15.3M	Domhnall Gleeson, Rachel McAdams, Bill Nighy, Lydia Wilson	69	about-time	6.9	abouttime	6.9

He's a mediocre computer programmer that lives in Tel Aviv and spends most of his energy searching online for a girlfriend. His only friend is Audrey, his beloved female dog. Eisenberg is a thug. Tall, fat, approaching middle age and not completely sane. He spends his days slouching around Meir Park, harassing innocent bystanders and doing business with petty thieves and small-time criminals. Unfortunately the two cross paths, and Eisenberg decides that they should start hanging out. But something in his demeanor says that he wants to be much more than just friends... Goldberg tries to avoid him, but Eisenberg's presence is everywhere: his apartment, his dating life, even his nightmares. When Eisenberg threatens Goldberg's beloved dog he realizes he must leave his manners behind, but his actions back-fire and events spin out of control. Goldberg is unwillingly drawn into Eisenberg's bizarre world, a world of petty thieves, Russian neo-Nazi punk rockers and Israeli "redneck" farmers... And the story gradually becomes darker and darker... This is a story about random meetings with strangers that lead to anxiety and paranoia. About lonely people in the big city. About losing control.	http://resizing.flixster.com/beHjHViNSgAzsnWA3T1Z5i13q_g=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/82/11188286_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/EQRDFQw6LHjnEeJgz0ECKI6NOvQ=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/82/11188286_ori.jpg	Drama, Horror, Thriller	Oren Carmi	Oren Carmi	22 Sep 2013	22 Jun 2015	\N	2015-06-22	90 min	N/A	Yitzhak Laor, Yahav Gal, Eran Bohem, Daniel Brusovani	\N	goldberg-and-eisenberg	0.0	goldbergandeisenberg	0.0
2210	771235120	Pacific Rim	When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.	http://resizing.flixster.com/2YR3bdS5sJScqAcl89KvMc5f7TY=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/39/11173933_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/xXxKG8aZ0KPN30l05l-Cz-WjZac=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/39/11173933_ori.jpg	Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi	Guillermo del Toro	Travis Beacham (screenplay), Guillermo del Toro (screenplay), Travis Beacham (story)	12 Jul 2013	15 Oct 2013	2013-07-12	2013-10-15	132 min	$101.8M	Charlie Hunnam, Diego Klattenhoff, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi	72	pacific-rim	7.2	pacificrim	7.2

574	771361033	Jersey Boys	Jersey Boys is a musical biography of the Four Seasons-the rise, the tough times and personal clashes, and the ultimate triumph of a group of friends whose music became symbolic of a generation. Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), Jersey Boys gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group-with a special focus on frontman Frankie Valli, the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming of age as performers, the core of the show is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats and family disasters. Jersey Boys is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public.	http://resizing.flixster.com/TgGitRqTjy2DeiCBGEA_dNhcHJE=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/75/11177548_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/hLZTS_X21W26TIC35AYxkJGledI=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/75/11177548_ori.jpg	Biography, Drama, Music	Clint Eastwood	Marshall Brickman (screenplay), Rick Elice (screenplay), Marshall Brickman (musical book), Rick Elice (musical book)	20 Jun 2014	11 Nov 2014	2014-06-20	2014-11-11	134 min	$47.0M	Vincent Piazza, John Lloyd Young, Steve Schirripa, Christopher Walken	52	jersey-boys	5.2	jerseyboys	5.2

In this hilarious and whip-smart performance, Kristina takes a surprisingly raucous approach to addressing the high rates of depression and suicide among Asian American women-she tries to single-handedly save them all with her show! She fails fantastically at the task, creating hysterical laughter that descends into a sobering coda. It's one hell of a roller coaster ride! But don't worry... it's all fiction.	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	Comedy, Drama	Mike Closson	Kristina Wong	01 Oct 2011	26 Nov 2013	\N	2013-11-26	90 min	N/A	Kristina Wong	\N	wong-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest	0.0	wongflewoverthecuckoosnest	0.0

1640	771358464	Dallas Buyers Club	Dallas 1985. Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof lives hard, which includes heavy smoking, drinking, drug use (primarily cocaine) and casual sex. He is racist and homophobic. While in the hospital on a work related injury, the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+, and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. Ron is initially in angry denial that he would have a disease that only "faggots" have, but upon quick reflection comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He begins to read whatever research is available about the disease, which at this time seems to be most effectively treated by the drug AZT. AZT, however, is only in the clinical trials stage within the US. Incredulous that he, as a dying man, cannot pay for any drug which may save or at least prolong his life, he goes searching for it by whatever means possible. It eventually leads him to Mexico and a "Dr." Vass, an American physician whose license was revoked in the US because of his AIDS related work against US regulations. Dr. Vass leads Ron to a cocktail of other drugs, some vitamins, he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms, since the virus, as Ron learns, will always be in the system of those who have been exposed to it. Ron begins to smuggle these drugs not approved by the FDA into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons. In this venture, he goes into an unlikely partnership with a HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon, who he met in the hospital and who has greater contact with AIDS patients through the gay community. As they try to work both above ground to get the meds to those that need them and underground to avoid detection by especially the FDA, Ron comes up with an idea to circumvent the fact of selling the drugs - which are not considered drugs yet since they are not FDA approved - directly to the HIV+ population, which then should should not be against the law. Richard Barkley and Dr. Sevard, the FDA's lead man on the file and one of Ron's doctors respectively, the latter who sees clinical trials as the only way to determine the efficacy of drugs despite the fact that Ron and others would have probably died already without these drugs, try to stop Ron and Rayon at every turn. Caught in the middle is Dr. Eve Saks, another of Ron's doctors, who understands why policies are place, but who can sympathize with Ron, Rayon and others - all her patients, directly or indirectly - in their situation.	http://resizing.flixster.com/9cYJN95qtbW5Nu_Mer1y9m8J0qg=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/60/11176064_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/t8iiyTyrOoVSxSkyUDjOUu6RGo4=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/60/11176064_ori.jpg	Biography, Drama	Jean-Marc Vallée	Craig Borten, Melisa Wallack	22 Nov 2013	04 Feb 2014	2013-11-01	2014-02-04	117 min	$27.3M	Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, Jared Leto, Denis O'Hare	93	dallas-buyers-club	9.3	dallasbuyersclub	9.3

2026	771353791	The Contractor	Retired CIA Black-Ops hit man James Jackson Dial is living his life in seclusion on his ranch in Montana when he is offered the chance to redeem himself by his former employer, Jeremy Collins. A few years ago, Dial was seconds away from taking down notorious terrorist cell leader Ali Mahmoud Jahar when when his carelessness allowed Jahar to escape, marking his mission as a failure. Now, Collins wants Dial to eliminate Jahar, who has been captured and is now in the custody of the police in London, England. Provided with a safe house, passports, and an assistant named Terry Winchell, Dial is off to London to finish what he started years ago. Disguised as a priest, Dial gets in position in a church's bell tower across the street from the building that Jahar is being brought into. When Jahar is brought out of his transport truck, his head is covered by a jacket, leaving Dial without a clean shot. Not wanting to fail again, Dial patiently waits for his opportunity. Moments later, Dial fatally shoots Jahar in the head. Because of a delay caused by a pair of cops, Winchell is late bringing the getaway car, and that brings attention to them fleeing the scene. After numerous attempts to stop the car, the police open fire, killing Winchell. The car, now out of control, comes to crashing stop, injuring Dial. On the run and bleeding profusely, Dial makes his way to the safe house, where he meets curious 12-year-old neighbor Emily Day, who lives with her grandmother. Emily helps Dial stop the bleeding. Even though Jahar was eliminated, the mission was a failure to Collins because Dial was observed fleeing the scene on a security camera. In the USA, Collins is being investigated for running a CIA Hit Squad, and if word gets back about Dial and the death of, Collins will be exposed. Stopping at nothing to keep his name clean, Collins frames Dial for the murder of Chief Inspector Andrew Windsor. Now a wanted man by Collins and the British police, Dial must do whatever it takes to prove his innocence, knowing that Inspector Annette Ballard, Windsor's vengeful daughter, is after him as well.	http://resizing.flixster.com/W75CtmIgwqBuu50M33vvo1Pfgtc=/320x475/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/31/11173170_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/0dTUvv4PRe9F-Oz01h2D1m6zIyE=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/31/11173170_ori.jpg	Action, Drama, Thriller	Josef Rusnak	Robert Foster (screenplay), Joshua Michael Stern (screenplay), Robert Katz (story), André Farwagi (story)	10 Jul 2007	10 Jul 2007	\N	2013-09-10	99 min	N/A	Wesley Snipes, Eliza Bennett, Lena Headey, Ralph Brown	\N	the-contractor	0.0	thecontractor	0.0

11	771356648	Cooper and Hemingway: The True Gen	Cooper and Hemingway: The True Gen is an unprecedented look at the bond between two of the most iconic artists of the 20th century.Utter opposites... nothing in common. The cowboy and the suburbanite. The conservative and the liberal. And yet these two artists (a word both men scoffed at) were the best of friends, right up to their deaths a mere seven weeks apart in 1961. But is the friendship of these two men really so surprising? A study of these two men is a study of the 20th century. Their internationally renowned careers (Cooper, two Best Actor Academy Awards; Hemingway, Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes) were played out over the same turbulent decades: the hedonistic 20s, the grim Depression 30s, the war-ravaged 40s, and the deceptively slumbering 50s; throughout, their public and private lives connected, parted, re-connected, intertwined, over-lapped, and collided. It is no small irony that the lives of these two men should suffer untimely ends at the dawn of the erupting sixties. Their final, poignant chapter closed at the beginning of a decade which would challenge many of the very ideals and precepts which both men so prominently represented.And yet, decades later, we have Liam Neeson reflecting: "...the character of Bryan Mills (Taken) fits into a cinematic iconic figure that we all recognize from way back ... I'm thinking of Gary Cooper in High Noon, who is kind of a Bryan Mills. That kind of iconic figure that audiences seem to be attracted to."Perhaps Cooper and Hemingway didn't really pass the torch, perhaps they merely leant it.	http://resizing.flixster.com/dbdD0CQqg5k8bYHf5Voq-4Vzj1s=/320x414/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/34/11173417_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/jBktyDYZobDjmkkJDHFWZfEKE98=/180x233/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/34/11173417_ori.jpg	Documentary	John Mulholland	John Mulholland	27 Sep 2013	08 Jun 2015	2013-10-11	2015-06-08	120 min	N/A	Len Cariou, Kirk Douglas, Peter Duchin, Charlton Heston	\N	cooper-and-hemingway-the-true-gen	0.0	cooperandhemingwaythetruegen	0.0

308	771387294	Survivor	Over the spring of 2000, sixteen average Americans (divided into two tribes which eventually merge into one) were sequestered on the deserted island of Pulau Tiga for 39 days. For their stay, they must learn to live as a tribe, although eventually, it is everyone for themselves. They compete in challenges for "luxuries" (a barbecue, a phone call home, etc.) and immunity. Every three days, the losers of the latter challenges must face tribal council, where they will account for their actions by voting one person off of the island. At the end of day 39, there will be only one survivor left who will leave the island with one million dollars. Based on the Swedish game show, "Operation Robinson."	http://resizing.flixster.com/1IegMH-I16CAtN-7wUeKxAnGFxU=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189167_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/44kg5HEzyv2lGJBuWEHjIeHAM50=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189167_ori.jpg	Adventure, Game-Show, Reality-TV	N/A	Charlie Parsons	31 May 2000	N/A	\N	2015-02-17	60 min	N/A	Jeff Probst	\N	survivor	0.0	survivor	0.0

At 87, Stritch is still here, dominating the stage in her one woman cabaret act, torturing Alec Baldwin on 30ROCK, giving us her take on aging, her struggle with alcohol and diabetes, and the fear of leaving the follow spot behind. In stolen moments from her corner room at the Carlyle, and on breaks from her tour and work, candid reflections about her life are punctuated with rare archival footage, words from friends (Hal Prince, George C. Wolfe, Nathan Lane, Cherry Jones and John Turturro) and photographs from her personal collection. By turns bold, hilarious and achingly poignant, the journey connects Stritch's present to her past, and an inspiring portrait of a one-of-a-kind survivor emerges.	http://resizing.flixster.com/kyFwp0PglABdjCAdGAThPOfLUT8=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/44/11174402_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/NAzmUtMa-a3fsqEc17uGVcC5uS4=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/44/11174402_ori.jpg	Documentary	Chiemi Karasawa	N/A	19 Apr 2013	24 Jun 2014	2014-02-21	2014-06-24	81 min	$0.3M	Alec Baldwin, Rob Bowman, Tina Fey, James Gandolfini	98	elaine-stritch-shoot-me	9.8	elainestritchshootme	9.8

Under the spiritual influence of the 'Singing River' as Native Americans called it, the music of Muscle Shoals changed the world and sold millions upon millions of copies. At its heart is Rick Hall who founded FAME Studios.

Vowing revenge, the fearless American stealthily tracks the killer from Osaka to Bangkok to Rangoon with the help of a wise and crafty sensei. His only clues: a series of victims whose necks bear the distinctive mark of strangulation by barbed wire. Fighting to avenge as well as to survive, Casey must sharpen his razor-like responses and take his battle skills to the next level, even using deep meditation to fake his own death. His target: the sinister drug lord Goro, who is flooding the streets with deadly meth cooked at his remote jungle factory. To prepare for his ultimate confrontation, Casey must finally become an invisible warrior worthy of the name Ninja. But just when his prey is cornered, an unexpected twist shows Casey that his battle is only beginning: he truly can trust no one.	http://resizing.flixster.com/PS0I8vOdRWt8-zRrKIZy5_fyOQo=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177873_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/ugYqOH2dJqAa9vJQL1YnvQZ-Myw=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177873_ori.jpg	Action, Crime, Thriller	Isaac Florentine	David N.

785	771351877	Free The Mind	In 1992 Professor Richard Davidson, one of the world's leading neuroscientists, met the Dalai Lama, who encouraged him to apply the same rigorous methods he used to study depression and anxiety to the study of compassion and kindness, those qualities cultivated by Tibetan meditation practice. The results of Davidson's studies at the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, are portrayed in Free the Mind as they are applied to treating PTSD in returning Iraqi vets and children with ADHD. The film poses two fundamental questions: What really is consciousness, and how does it manifest in the brain and body? And is it possible to physically change the brain solely through mental practices?	http://resizing.flixster.com/QN_jlgjYu-ePO6tC4MGA0msWqr0=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/03/11170368_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/e16BPcxqqcCS4RK4gRm5Cf7B3c0=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/03/11170368_ori.jpg	Documentary, Adventure	Phie Ambo	Phie Ambo (story), Phie Ambo	03 May 2013	23 Sep 2014	2013-05-03	2014-09-23	80 min	$0.2M	Richard Davidson, Emma Seppala, John Osborne, Deborah Alagna	73	free-the-mind	7.3	freethemind	7.3

Well, to be fair, he has made some progress in the field of thoughtfulness (he has even become a writer) but as concerns his everyday life, it is far from well-ordered. To be totally honest it is not entirely Xavier's fault if his wife Wendy has suddenly left him for a new companion in New York and taken their two children with her. Realizing he can't stand living without them, Xavier decides to settle down in Big Apple in order to remain close to them.

740	771354559	Flex Is Kings	"Flexing" is a dance style forged in far east Brooklyn, at the dead-end of a handful of subway lines. Flex dancers channel the grittiness and crime of East New York into choreographed violence with gun movements, simulated bone-breaking, and the mimicked ripping of hearts from opponent's chests. Through battles dancers gain respect, craft an artistic identity, and sometimes find a sanctuary from the poverty and violence that saturates their neighborhood. No other style of street-dance is this violent, scary, or beautifully theatrical. In this purely do-it-yourself scene, creativity and ambition bring a community together around frequent dance-battle showcases that have begun to attract an international audience and may catapult the best dancers into careers in theater or film. Following a group of dancers for over two years, Flex is Kings explores the hopes and realities of this under-acknowledged and totally unfunded group of urban artists.	http://resizing.flixster.com/JXFAIgLF9fzXpmGjElI1zssEzH0=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/71/11177136_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/ilEwU4_Fol78ZLDBO7UOATMzYsE=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/71/11177136_ori.jpg	Documentary	Michael Beach Nichols, Deidre Schoo	N/A	18 Apr 2013	06 Oct 2014	2014-04-04	2014-10-06	80 min	N/A	Dj Aaron, Anime, Kareem Baptiste, Raynold Jarell Blackman	67	flex-is-kings	6.7	flexiskings	6.7

Notoriously private, self-described as the 'best known author of unknown works,' Marker is widely known for a few key cinematic works such as LA JETEE (1963) and SANS SOLEIL (1983), but his wider filmography remains undiscovered. Through interviews with Marker's colleagues and admirers, Omori lovingly describes a man whose preference for personal privacy has rendered him perhaps cinema's most famous enigma: a man who is his works. --Samuel B.

Travers' Mary Poppins (1964), he made them a promise - one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history.	http://resizing.flixster.com/1IY4C9342mfDX5VCUBNrXn7-gwM=/320x458/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/25/11172532_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/Ln_GAOQN90Rt8kKlBo2pTV-2aeg=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/25/11172532_ori.jpg	Biography, Comedy, Drama	John Lee Hancock	Kelly Marcel, Sue Smith	20 Dec 2013	18 Mar 2014	2013-12-20	2014-03-18	125 min	$83.3M	Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, Annie Rose Buckley, Colin Farrell	80	saving-mr-banks	8.0	savingmrbanks	8.0

Musician, psychiatrist, and folk dancer Clark Wang prepares for his own green burial in this immersive documentary.

1329	771363612	Gloria	Mild mannered Jack Dawn has been secretly working as an accountant for the mob. He, his Puerto Rican wife Jeri, his teen-aged daughter Joan and his mother-in-law, all who were planning on going on the run, are murdered by the mob because Jack was going to inform on them to the FBI. Before they're killed, Jack and Jeri are able to send their six-year old son Phil to Jeri's friend and their neighbor, Gloria Swenson, for safe keeping. Also with Phil is the book which contains all the information Jack was going to turn over. Gloria and Phil have an antagonistic relationship, not so much for who they are but what they are, Phil a kid, and Gloria a strange white woman who hates kids. As an ex-mistress of a mobster, Gloria learns that the people that killed the Dawns are old friends of hers. As Gloria and Phil go on the run both from the mob and from the authorities (who believe she kidnapped Phil) throughout New York City, Gloria has to come up with a plan on how best to save themselves, which is not easy because of their love/hate relationship and the fact that precocious Phil has a mind of his own. That plan includes what to do with the book, but more importantly how to save Phil as the mob would still be after him regardless of the book just in case he knows something about his father's dealings. All through their ordeal, Gloria is not averse to shooting to kill, especially if those who she is trying to kill are trying to kill her and Phil first.	http://resizing.flixster.com/INrqjstbMG7o4myJScBcBFQrK5c=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/75/11177581_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/3B-9e5C1KKudzaUIbH-9ZJIVt2E=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/75/11177581_ori.jpg	Crime, Drama, Thriller	John Cassavetes	John Cassavetes	19 Sep 1980	25 Feb 2003	2014-01-24	2014-04-28	123 min	N/A	Julie Carmen, Tony Knesich, Gregory Cleghorne, Buck Henry	99	gloria	9.9	gloria	9.9

1425	771372845	Don't Ask Me Questions: The Unsung Life of Graham Parker and the Rumour	THE FOCUS: Graham Parker has recorded and performed non-stop for the last 35 years. Refusing to compromise, Graham marched to his own drum. Together with his passionately remembered band the Rumour, Graham was the inspiration for artists that followed him. But in the end he defied the movement that he helped spark. And when the music business continued to change beyond recognition, he remained true to his musical vision. A modern troubadour, Graham releases new music almost on a yearly basis, while touring small clubs around the country to a die hard fan base. THE TWIST: Graham, at 59 years old, has had a slight change of heart. He just may be ready to go commercial. Leaning on his publishing company to place his music in ads and TV shows Graham makes his last attempt at selling while not selling out. The film documents the history of his independent spirit and defiant optimism, celebrates the sincerity of his music and delights in his self-deprecating wit.	http://resizing.flixster.com/_JM5iBOOk4nXRcrd8xLYXaKW6To=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/83/11188360_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/iyxA41o8M73K0hztEEs8-CCKVVQ=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/83/11188360_ori.jpg	Documentary, Music	Michael Gramaglia	N/A	11 Oct 2013	07 Apr 2014	\N	2014-04-07	95 min	N/A	Judd Apatow, Nick Lowe, Graham Parker, Bruce Springsteen	\N	dont-ask-me-questions-the-unsung-life-of-graham-parker-and-the-rumour	0.0	dontaskmequestionstheunsunglifeofgrahamparkerandtherumour	0.0

Over the next two days, he questions, demands, begs, and parries with her: why did she leave, why did she return, does she love him, did she ever love him, who is her lover, is she passionate with her lover? She's calm as alabaster, reserved. Is she in danger? When she makes an offer, how will he respond?	http://resizing.flixster.com/0ivSOxsgGcw-_nFWEXcICz01BC4=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/47/11174742_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/x09CVVuJsvxpd1WDgAdp_Tb0060=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/47/11174742_ori.jpg	Drama, Romance	Patrice Chéreau	Patrice Chéreau, Anne-Louise Trividic, Joseph Conrad (novel)	09 Sep 2005	19 Dec 2006	2014-07-04	2014-10-20	90 min	$89.7k	Isabelle Huppert, Pascal Greggory, Claudia Coli, Thierry Hancisse	95	gabrielle	9.5	gabrielle	9.5

2203	771357945	Assaulted: CIVIL Rights Under Fire	With the original intention of empowering a citizenry's ability to defend themselves against a corrupt or tyrannical government, the concept today may seem farfetched or the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster. However, it has happened throughout U.S. history. And long before gun control was positioned as a "common sense measure" to combat violence, it was used as a means to oppress certain minority groups. Presently, the growing trend in gun control favors the wealthy and privileged, who leverage their connections to ensure their Second Amendment rights and safety, while those of lesser means struggle. Informative and emotionally charged, "Assaulted: Civil Rights Under Fire" is an eye-opening look at the genesis of the Second Amendment to the Constitution, leading the audience to rethink the issues surrounding gun control, and the effect on civil rights and liberty. After all, what you don't know can kill you.	http://resizing.flixster.com/CDQMe1gV57Dei1C_PmGWXxbW-KM=/319x457/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/18/11171870_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/GgAr09TcmVRG8ysb8FGnLCjXOO4=/179x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/18/11171870_ori.jpg	Documentary	Kris Koenig	Kris Koenig	20 Jun 2013	N/A	2013-06-20	2013-10-14	79 min	N/A	Margot Bennett, Chris Cheng, Alan Gottlieb, Dan Gross	60	assaulted-civil-rights-under-fire	6.0	assaultedcivilrightsunderfire	6.0

As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that Aurora holds the key to peace in the kingdom - and perhaps to Maleficent's true happiness as well.	http://resizing.flixster.com/OZhI0-fGQCj7ixx2oBbddMebqWw=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/12/11181292_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/YukULOFULUesVZccNjOZzF1YX30=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/12/11181292_ori.jpg	Action, Adventure, Family	Robert Stromberg	Linda Woolverton (screenplay), Charles Perrault (based on the story "La Belle au bois dormant" by), Erdman Penner (based on the motion picture "Sleeping Beauty",  story adaptation by), Joe Rinaldi (based on the motion picture "Sleeping Beauty",  screenplay by), Winston Hibler (based on the motion picture "Sleeping Beauty",  screenplay by), Bill Peet (based on the motion picture "Sleeping Beauty",  screenplay by), Ted Sears (based on the motion picture "Sleeping Beauty",  screenplay by), Ralph Wright (based on the motion picture "Sleeping Beauty",  screenplay by), Milt Banta (based on the motion picture "Sleeping Beauty",  screenplay by)	30 May 2014	04 Nov 2014	2014-05-30	2014-11-04	97 min	$241.4M	Angelina Jolie, Elle Fanning, Sharlto Copley, Lesley Manville	49	maleficent	4.9	maleficent	4.9

535	771315448	Lines of Wellington	On September 27, 1810, the French troops commanded by Marshal Massena, were defeated in the Serra do Buçaco by the Anglo-Portuguese army of general Wellington. Despite the victory, Portuguese and British are forced to retreat from the enemy, numerically superior, in order to attract them to Torres Vedras, where Wellington had built fortified lines hardly surmountable. Simultaneously, the Anglo-Portuguese command organizes the evacuation of the entire territory between the battlefield and the lines of Torres Vedras, a gigantic burned land operation, which prevents the French from collecting supplies. This is the setting for the adventures of a multitude of characters from all social backgrounds - soldiers and civilians, men, women and children, young and old - to the daily routine torn by war and dragged through hills and valleys, between ruined villages, charred forests and devastated crops.Highly persecuted by the French, already tormented by an unmerciful weather, the mass of fugitives continues to move forward clenching the teeth, just to save their skin, loaded with tenacious will to resist the invaders and retreat them from their country. Or even hoping to take advantage of the disarray to satisfy their basic instincts. All of them, whatever nature or motivations - the idealistic young lieutenant Pedro De Alencar, Clarissa Warren, the malicious little English girl, the shady dealer Penabranca, the vindictive Sergeant Francisco Xavier or the lusty prostitute Martírio, all gather by different paths to the lines of Torres, where the final battle will decide the fate of each one of them.	http://resizing.flixster.com/GQcxRZm7b-Rv5RN4RyiV3j_-aas=/320x461/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/51/11175111_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/3Ilv1SXJfK8P9GmHu0eJ8iWtF1g=/180x260/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/51/11175111_ori.jpg	Drama, History, War	Valeria Sarmiento	Carlos Saboga	04 Oct 2012	25 Nov 2014	\N	2014-11-25	151 min	N/A	Nuno Lopes, Soraia Chaves, Marisa Paredes, John Malkovich	\N	lines-of-wellington	0.0	linesofwellington	0.0

Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster awaits the return of Thor although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall, who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared.

When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki.

Featuring rare footage from his 1970s TV appearances (doing 3-card Monte with Steve Martin on The Dinah Shore Show) and told in Jay's inimitable voice, this is a remarkable journey inside the secretive world of magic and the small circle of eccentrics who are its perpetual devotees.	http://resizing.flixster.com/5ZYjX0Pq9nhRn6FxChADJtzbSSI=/320x475/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/08/11170896_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/ZkP8a02jniZ_RpgrluuAwEu7yio=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/08/11170896_ori.jpg	Documentary	Molly Bernstein	N/A	04 Oct 2012	04 Nov 2013	2013-04-17	2013-11-04	88 min	$0.2M	Ricky Jay, Winston Simon, Dick Cavett, David Mamet	90	deceptive-practice-the-mysteries-and-mentors-of-ricky-jay	9.0	deceptivepracticethemysteriesandmentorsofrickyjay	9.0

Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.	http://resizing.flixster.com/L4VeseHwTgfA5kkZ0rdy-s3Fj-I=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/05/11180503_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/GYMWis0jh-eDQ4XTme67G4JJZcs=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/05/11180503_ori.jpg	Comedy, Drama	Jon Favreau	Jon Favreau	30 May 2014	30 Sep 2014	2014-05-09	2014-09-30	114 min	N/A	Jon Favreau, John Leguizamo, Bobby Cannavale, Emjay Anthony	86	chef	8.6	chef	8.6

1955	771269579	AmeriQua	AmeriQua is the story of a lazy recent graduate, Charlie (Bobby Kennedy), whose rich parents cut him off with a $5000 check and an ultimatum to start a life of independence and responsibility. Instead, he buys a plane ticket to Italy, gets robbed upon arrival and winds up in Bologna in the care of his new friend Lele (Lele Gabellone), the self-proclaimed King of Bologna, who lives with a scraggly punkabbestia, Ballo (Gianlucca Bazzoli), and the insatiable prostitute frequenter, Il Pisa (Giuseppe Sanfelice). In Bologna, Lele teaches Chrlie the subtle strategies that the King knows so well, namely hitting on Italian women, throwing all-night parties and inciting general anarchy. Charlie takes to it like a pro and in the process meets the dangerously beautiful Valentina (Alessandra Mastronardi) and all-American Jessica (Eva Amurri). It may have been a simple story of cultural exchange had Charlie not accidentally pissed off two vicious mafia bosses, Don Ferracane (Giancarlo Giannini) and Don Farina (Ernesto Mahieux) in his wanderings. What chance does a timid American kid, who doesn't speak Italian and hangs out with sloppy Italian party hounds, have against the dark forces of organized crime in Italy?	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	Comedy	Marco Bellone, Giovanni Consonni	Matteo Bortolotti, Bobby Kennedy III, Caterina Mazzuccato	28 Feb 2013	24 Sep 2013	\N	2013-09-24	103 min	N/A	Bobby Kennedy III, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Mary Stewart, Alessandra Mastronardi	\N	ameriqua	0.0	ameriqua	0.0

His buddies even call him Don Jon because of his ability to pull "10s" every weekend without fail. Yet even the finest flings don't compare to the transcendent bliss he achieves alone in front of the computer watching pornography. Dissatisfied, he embarks on a journey to find a more gratifying sex life, but ends up learning larger lessons of life and love through relationships with two very different women.	http://resizing.flixster.com/qa-2nkMZmle0Wjth0pPAzG0ZX8E=/311x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/20/11172099_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/mLruvxOPY8YaLat6iZ2t6wauePM=/175x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/20/11172099_ori.jpg	Comedy, Drama, Romance	Joseph Gordon-Levitt	Joseph Gordon-Levitt	27 Sep 2013	31 Dec 2013	2013-09-27	2013-12-31	90 min	$24.5M	Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza	80	don-jon	8.0	donjon	8.0

Rory has just flown down to Los Angeles to spend time with Justin, his Hollywood movie star brother. Rory once had minor success in Hollywood as an actor, and encouraged Justin to give Hollywood a try. Once close, their relationship has changed by Justin's stardom, especially as Rory tries to find his place in the world. Jerry, a schizophrenic, is at a crossroads in his life. As such, his sister, Louise, feels that she needs to take care of him, especially as he was her protector when they were growing up. Louise would like to tell Jerry what she really thinks but doesn't know if she is brave enough to tell off a mentally ill person. Their relationship has an added complication in Ringo, Jerry's new ageist lawyer. Nikki doesn't see her older half sister Maggie much, only when Maggie calls whenever she is in trouble and needs help. Nikki, a struggling actress, would like a "Nikki" in her life, which she really needs as she deals with Henry, a so-called producer willing to give her her big break. And seventeen year old Sarah, an only child, has troubles communicating with her mother, Marion, the two who each feels the other takes up every ounce of emotional space in their household. The arrival of thirty-something South Asian Sita into their lives may show both what they have been missing in their relationship.	http://resizing.flixster.com/e9uY7jDhCEGrmTlwDibxOlHyFa0=/175x239/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/72/11187272_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/e9uY7jDhCEGrmTlwDibxOlHyFa0=/175x239/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/72/11187272_ori.jpg	Comedy	Carl Bessai	Carl Bessai (a collective creation by), Jay Brazeau (a collective creation by), Amanda Crew (a collective creation by), Leena Manro (a collective creation by), Gabrielle Miller (a collective creation by), Dustin Milligan (a collective creation by), Cory Monteith (a collective creation by), Ben Ratner (a collective creation by), Kacey Rohl (a collective creation by), Gabrielle Rose (a collective creation by), Tom Scholte (a collective creation by), Camille Sullivan (a collective creation by)	10 Sep 2013	N/A	\N	2013-09-10	90 min	N/A	Cory Monteith, Gabrielle Miller, Amanda Crew, Kacey Rohl	\N	sisters-and-brothers	0.0	sistersandbrothers	0.0

1529	771361342	JFK: The Smoking Gun	Seventy-five percent of the American people still refuse to believe the official story of President John F. Kennedy's death. They do not think he was killed by a lone gunman but by a mysterious cabal that somehow conspired to have him killed. How can this be? How can a crime this famous, witnessed and investigated by so many, remain a mystery? This is what veteran Australian police detective Colin McLaren is determined to find out. JFK: The Smoking Gun follows the forensic cold-case investigation McLaren conducted over four painstaking years, taking us back to that tragic day in Dallas at Dealey Plaza where the shooting took place, to Parkland Hospital where the president was pronounced dead, to the Bethesda Naval Hospital where the autopsy was conducted and to the conclusions of the Warren Commission that have remained controversial to this day. Driven by a seasoned police detective who, thanks to modern technology, finally had access to all the facts and to witness testimony, the documentary uses logic, reason and time-tested investigative techniques to solve a crime that is every bit as shocking and incredible today as it was when it first happened 50 years ago. Colin McLaren believes he has found "the smoking gun" that killed JFK. Once you've seen this film, he's confident you will believe it, too.	http://resizing.flixster.com/aIsfvo57zUA0JuAkN-7V1md-9K4=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/81/11188173_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/EyQRmLIO2VQzQpU4qUGdb-HtVF4=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/81/11188173_ori.jpg	Documentary	Malcolm Mcdonald	Steve Lucas	16 Nov 2013	10 Mar 2014	2013-11-16	2014-03-10	120 min	N/A	Alex Ivanovici, Howard Donahue, Colin McLaren, Colleen Lorenzen	\N	jfk-the-smoking-gun	0.0	jfkthesmokinggun	0.0

436	771377991	Get On Up	On route to the stage, singer James Brown recalls a life with a turbulent childhood where music was his only constructive release for his passions. A chance demonstration of that in prison led to a new friend who helped get him out and into a musical career. With his fire and creative daring, Brown became a star who defiantly created new possibilities in show business both on and behind the stage in face of racism and conventional thinking. Along the way, James would also become a peacemaker who redefined and raised the African-American community's feeling of self-worth when it was needed most. However, those same domineering passions would lead James Brown alienating everyone around him as his appetites became ever more self-destructive. Only after he hit rock bottom with a serious mistake does Brown realize what he needs to do make his life as the Godfather of Soul truly worthwhile.	http://resizing.flixster.com/VYN4yIXYUFHrQp7Gk8AamcCEjwM=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/18/11181877_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/3RU8fbC7T5j7prAqTejyE_RrgjU=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/18/11181877_ori.jpg	Biography, Drama, Music	Tate Taylor	Jez Butterworth (screenplay), John-Henry Butterworth (screenplay), Steven Baigelman (story), Jez Butterworth (story), John-Henry Butterworth (story)	01 Aug 2014	06 Jan 2015	2014-08-01	2015-01-06	139 min	N/A	Chadwick Boseman, Nelsan Ellis, Dan Aykroyd, Viola Davis	80	get-on-up	8.0	getonup	8.0

As they duke it out in a half-savage half-civilized fashion, these characters, and the truths behind their long history of conflict and tragedy, are slowly and surprisingly revealed.	http://resizing.flixster.com/FUlLjdDeI3y9TVMs9Ht833t6Iq0=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/68/11186801_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/bRycHKcyl9E_FdiMuvzRb04bJ3Q=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/68/11186801_ori.jpg	Drama	Terry Miles	Terry Miles	10 Sep 2010	N/A	2010-09-10	2014-11-09	90 min	N/A	Jennifer Beals, Gil Bellows, John Pyper-Ferguson, Kathleen Robertson	\N	a-night-for-dying-tigers	0.0	anightfordyingtigers	0.0

918	771380714	Aleister Crowley: Legend of the Beast	Since the onset of the human race there have been those who instinctively understood the nature of reality and sought to impose their will upon it by co-operating with and honoring the forces that governed it. Although History has left a rich legacy of Magick, Magicians and Wizards with such names as Pythagoras, Paracelsus, John Dee, Cagliostro, Israel Regardi and Eliphas Levi, in the modern era there is only one whose name is still spoken with fearful reverence as the most powerful and influential magician who ever lived - Aleister Crowley. Hailed as the wickedest man alive and called the Great Beast 666 by his own mother, Crowley was also one of the most accomplished philosophers, poets, authors, mountain climbers, chess players and sensationalists of his or any other time. Aleister Crowley was a magnet to all, many were drawn to his presence and exceptional wisdom but there were also those that he repelled. This film looks back on one man's amazing journey from his death bed. From his devout Christian upbringing through his many aspirations as he looks back on his life, the sadness, the triumphs, the glory and the pain of how he lived and loved. The myth of the Satanist is dispelled and the true nature of a flawed but great man is left. A man who dared to live by his own true will in a time of ignorance, a man with many demons who invoked and manifested unimaginable spiritual forces, a man who truly understood the realms beyond our reality and claimed, "Do What You Wilt Shall Be The Whole Of The Law." Reality Is What You Make It.	http://resizing.flixster.com/O8wPseC893aYD359bSSLuWSRcd4=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/84/11188455_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/TLWVxz5V7ve6tuvMIXr85xQAh7Q=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/84/11188455_ori.jpg	Biography, Drama	Dom Lenoir	Dom Lenoir	01 Jan 2013	26 Aug 2014	\N	2014-08-26	80 min	N/A	Henry Amphlett, Elle Black, Claire Bowen, Kathryn Carpenter	\N	aleister-crowley-legend-of-the-beast	0.0	aleistercrowleylegendofthebeast	0.0

1228	771354623	Run & Jump	Vanetia Casey (Maxine Peake), the spirited and impossibly optimistic center of the Casey family, is working hard to get life back to normal after her 38 year-old husband, Conor (Edward MacLiam), suffers a rare stroke which changes his personality. Tweedy American doctor, Ted Fielding, (Will Forte) arrives in Ireland to stay with them for two months: his research grant providing the Caseys with essential financial aid. Vanetia's a dynamo. But with two young kids and both men in the house, she's feeling bombarded and initially treats Ted and his study of Conor with resistance. Only when she observes Ted's calming influence on the family does she begin to value his friendship, and, in return, Ted enjoys their heady, happy-go-lucky world. But Ted's continued presence in the house sets the family on course for an emotional collision. Directed by Academy Award®-nominee Steph Green and featuring Saturday Night Live star Will Forte in an impressive dramatic debut, this life-affirming film embraces the healing power of love and family in all of its idiosyncratic forms. Run and Jump is an unexpected, unconventional romance, intimate family portrait and emotional journey of recovery.	http://resizing.flixster.com/TQ90Zx2aMzARqgSHVoWCmaW-OJ0=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/55/11175591_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/Dy4GysePsz5PAViAwWt7nAHLXLM=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/55/11175591_ori.jpg	Drama	Steph Green	Steph Green, Ailbhe Keogan	24 Jan 2014	27 May 2014	2014-01-24	2014-05-27	106 min	$8.2k	Ciara Gallagher, Maxine Peake, Edward MacLiam, Will Forte	89	run-and-jump	8.9	runandjump	8.9

2062	771315039	Kon Tiki	The Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl crossed the Pacific Ocean in a balsawood raft in 1947, together with five men, to prove that South Americans back in pre-Columbian times could have crossed the ocean and settled on Polynesian islands. After financing the trips with loans and donations, they set off on an epic 101-day-long trip across 8000 kilometers, while the world was waiting for the result of the trip. The film tells about the origin of the idea, the preparations, and the events on the trip. The "Kon-Tiki" was named after the Inca sun god, Viracocha, and "Kon-Tiki" is an old name for this god. Heyerdahl filmed the expedition, which later became the Academy Award winning documentary in 1951, and he wrote a book about the expedition that was translated into 70 languages and sold more than 50 millions copies around the world. Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in pre-Columbian times, although most anthropologists now believe they did not. Anyway he proved that it was possible by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at that time. The trip took 101 days over 4,300 miles across the Pacific Ocean before the "Kon-Tiki" crashed onto the dangerous reefs outside Raroia in the Tuamotu Islands on August 7, 1947. All crewmen survived, and the "Kon-Tiki" was taken back to Norway. She is now featured in the Kon-Tiki Museum.	http://resizing.flixster.com/gu6-AyTeBzJ2pXuMVHn8sBqjx3k=/319x457/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/76/11167601_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/WZhYxz1S2Toza6qoKLXJCCa_6Uw=/179x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/76/11167601_ori.jpg	Adventure, History	Joachim Rønning, Espen Sandberg	Petter Skavlan, Allan Scott (script consultant)	26 Apr 2013	27 Aug 2013	2013-04-26	2013-08-27	118 min	$1.5M	Pål Sverre Hagen, Anders Baasmo Christiansen, Tobias Santelmann, Gustaf Skarsgård	85	kon-tiki	8.5	kontiki	8.5

1820	771312521	Four	Reed Richards, a brilliant but timid and bankrupt scientist, is convinced that evolution can be triggered by clouds of cosmic energy, and has calculated that Earth is going to pass one of these clouds soon. Together with his friend and partner, the gruff yet gentle astronaut muscle-man Ben Grimm, Reed convinces his conceited MIT classmate Dr. Victor Von Doom, now CEO of his own enterprise, to allow him access to his privately-owned space station. Von Doom agrees in exchange for control over the experiment and a majority of the profits from whatever benefits it brings. He thus brings aboard Susan Storm, his shy, though assertive chief genetics researcher and a former lover of Reed's with whom she had an acrimonious break-up, and her diametrically opposed brother Johnny, the maverick and hot-headed playboy pilot. The astronauts make it home intact; however, before long they begin to mutate, developing strange and amazing powers as a result of their exposure to the cloud! Reed is able to stretch like rubber; Sue can turn invisible and create force fields, especially when angered; Johnny can produce fire at supernova temperatures, and is able to fly; and Ben is transformed into "The Thing", a large, rock-like creature with super strength. After Ben, brooding about his situation on the Brooklyn Bridge, inadvertently causes a major traffic pile-up whilst attempting to stop a man about to commit suicide, the four manage to use their powers to prevent any loss of life and to rescue a fire truck and its crew from falling off the bridge in a resulting explosion. The media dubs the team the 'Fantastic Four', and whilst Johnny eagerly embraces his powers and new life, Ben - the most heavily disfigured - particularly suffers from his transformation; his disfigurement has caused his fiancée to abandon him and has seen him shunned and feared by much of New York. Blaming himself, Reed vows to return Ben to his human form, and he, Sue and Ben work on a cure, constructing a healing chamber in Reed's high tech Baxter Building loft-turned-laboratory. During this time, Reed and Susan begin to grow close once again, and Susan admits that she is not interested in Victor, but ended their relationship because Reed feared to commit, thinking only in terms of variables. Unknown to the others, however, Victor's body is also mutating; he is turning into organic metal capable of absorbing and manipulating electrical energy known as Doctor Doom. As a result of the disastrous expedition, his company is going bankrupt and he is losing public stature; blaming Reed for his misfortunes, Victor swears revenge. And Reed, Ben, Susan, and Johnny must defeat Victor Von Doom and foil his evil plans once and for all.	http://resizing.flixster.com/IQlGAP2__7u_-peamjkxxCd5P2s=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/34/11173408_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/qltO7OO_TvamlQStyI29dJH5acs=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/34/11173408_ori.jpg	Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi	Tim Story	Mark Frost, Michael France, Stan Lee (Marvel comic book), Jack Kirby (Marvel comic book)	08 Jul 2005	06 Dec 2005	2013-09-13	2014-01-14	106 min	$154.5M	Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis	\N	four	0.0	four	0.0

106	771379421	Mommy	Forty-six year old Diane Després - "Die" - has been widowed for three years. Considered white trash by many, Die does whatever she needs, including strutting her body in front of male employers who will look, to make an honest living. That bread-winning ability is affected when she makes the decision to remove her only offspring, fifteen year old Steve Després, from her previously imposed institutionalization, one step below juvenile detention. She institutionalized him shortly following her husband's death due to Steve's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and his violent outbursts. He was just kicked out of the latest in a long line of facilities for setting fire to the cafeteria, in turn injuring another boy. She made this decision to deinstitutionalize him as she didn't like the alternative, sending him into more restrictive juvenile detention from which he would probably never be rehabilitated. However, with this deinstitutionalization, she has to take care of him which means only being able to do home based work. Despite they always yelling expletives at each other and Steve sometimes demonstrating those violent tendencies toward her, Die and Steve truly do love each other, his emotions which are sometimes manifested as an Oedipus complex especially as he seems to need her complete attention most specifically when it is being directed at possible male suitors. Their lives, both individually and as a family, are affected with the entrance of two of their neighbors. The first is Paul, a lawyer, who does have that sexual interest in Die as he tries to help Steve through his legal problems. The second and more important is Kyla, who lives across the street with her husband Patrick and their adolescent daughter, they who are in transit in their life to wherever Patrick's job will take them. Kyla is a high school teacher on sabbatical as she deals with her own emotional issues, which are manifested in stuttering whenever she feels incapable of dealing with her life. Kyla may find that she needs the Després as much as they need her.	http://resizing.flixster.com/i-GmmBJ1oTWQfBEOC_U_DuuSOeY=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/07/11180749_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/b29V_xvqQnWcKvm0sY6juynemhc=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/07/11180749_ori.jpg	Drama	Xavier Dolan	Xavier Dolan	08 Oct 2014	28 Apr 2015	2015-01-23	2015-04-28	139 min	N/A	Anne Dorval, Suzanne Clément, Antoine-Olivier Pilon, Patrick Huard	90	mommy	9.0	mommy	9.0

In 1957, Beverly was working at Warner Brothers studios with a fake birth certificate saying she was 18 -- she was in fact, only 15 -- when she encountered the former matinée idol. After a bumpy start, the two undertook a relationship that was ultimately embraced by Beverly's Hollywood mother Florence, who became a willing third wheel. The affair took them from L.A. to New York to Africa, then to Cuba where Flynn pitched in with the rebels to make a pro-Castro propaganda movie starring Beverly. It all came crashing to an end in Vancouver, however, when Flynn died in Beverly's arms, causing an avalanche of publicity; Florence finally achieved the attention she sought in the form of tabloid notoriety but the chaos drove Beverly to the edge of sanity. The Last of Robin Hood is a poignant yet darkly comic coming-of-age tale about the desire for fame and the price it exacts.	http://resizing.flixster.com/J3nPmhqyJ21S0q7xUre2d7y_BkY=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/99/11189928_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/w7xqPtlpELXX9lGx9SeplMd0Jjw=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/99/11189928_ori.jpg	Biography, Drama, Romance	Richard Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland	Richard Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland	05 Dec 2014	03 Mar 2015	2014-08-29	2015-03-03	94 min	$0.3M	Dakota Fanning, Susan Sarandon, Kevin Kline, Bryan Batt	29	the-last-of-robin-hood	2.9	thelastofrobinhood	2.9

2296	771361860	Cosmic Psychos: Blokes You Can Trust	For 30 years, the Cosmic Psychos have blazed a trail of empty beer cans and busted ear drums around the globe with their quintessential Australian drawl and pounding punk rock songs. With the founding member Ross Knight finding inspiration from the Bulldozer he drove on the family farm in country Victoria, the band forged a unique sound and image that resonated with punk rock fans everywhere. Iconic label Sup Pop! released their second album when the band fell into the 'Seattle' scene of the late 80's amidst the likes of Pearl Jam, Mudhoney and The Melvins. Never quite finding the mainstream success of their grunge counterparts, the band managed to tour heavily in the USA and Europe thanks to a large and devoted fan base. The Cosmic Psychos were notorious for their ability to drink pubs dry, earning them a reputation that resonated around as a warning - "Never drink with the 'Psychos". But it wasn't all shits and giggles. A heavy falling out with drummer and founding member Bill Walsh resulted in a line-up change and a bitter dedication on their new album with the song 'Kill Bill'. They've been ripped off by several record labels, and dealt with the tragedy of the passing of guitarist Robbie Watts in 2006. But the band continues through all its adversity to remain strong to this day with Dean Muller on drums and John 'Mad Macca' McKeering from the Onya's taking care of the guitar duties. COSMIC PSYCHOS : BLOKES YOU CAN TRUST follows the bands colorful history, as well as the enigmatic and entertaining founding member Ross Knight, to get behind the man who rides the bulldozer. Farmer, Father, Weightlifter, and frontman. His story alone, and told from his perspective is a unique portrait of an unlikely and revered rock and roll bloke.	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default.gif	Music	Matt Weston	N/A	08 Aug 2013	05 Nov 2013	\N	2013-11-05	N/A	N/A	Mark Arm, Ross Knight, Bruce Milne, Buzz Osborne	\N	cosmic-psychos-blokes-you-can-trust	0.0	cosmicpsychosblokesyoucantrust	0.0

1562	770682443	Mr. Nobody	In the year 2092, one hundred eighteen year old Nemo is recounting his life story to a reporter. He is less than clear, often times thinking that he is only thirty-four years of age. But his story becomes more confusing after he does focus on the fact of his current real age. He tells of his life at three primary points in his life: at age nine (when his parents divorced), age sixteen and age thirty-four. The confusing aspect of the story is that he tells of alternate life paths, often changing course with the flick of a decision at each of those ages. One life path has him ultimately married to Elise, a depressed woman who never got over the unrequited love she had for a guy named Stefano when she was a teenager and who asked Nemo to swear that when she died he would sprinkle her ashes on Mars. A second life path has him married to Jean. Their life is one of luxury but one also of utter boredom. And a third life path has him in a torrid romance with his step-sister Anna, the two who, as adults, would search for each other after having been torn apart as teenagers. These life paths also intersect, with the three women sometimes entering the alternate life in some other aspect. Are any of these lives real or are they all a figment of his imagination?	http://resizing.flixster.com/zal_0jgIHLYEs93JSHI2Ki4og-Y=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/32/11173220_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/UqDyaU-JRLjU3ZW86hAAokflgJs=/180x266/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/32/11173220_ori.jpg	Drama, Fantasy, Romance	Jaco Van Dormael	Jaco Van Dormael	26 Sep 2013	25 Feb 2014	2013-11-01	2014-02-25	141 min	$3.6k	Jared Leto, Sarah Polley, Diane Kruger, Linh Dan Pham	64	mr-nobody	6.4	mrnobody	6.4

Fresh out of law school and full of hope for the future, Renny Jacobson is stunned by his father's sudden death--and then by the terms of the will: the elder Jacobson has left the bulk of his estate to charity. For his only son, he has left nothing more than the contents of a deposit box and interest in a company no one has heard of--the Covenant List of South Carolina, Ltd. When Renny encounters lovely Jo Johnston, meets the members of "The List," and discovers the staggering value of his father's mysterious bequest, his hope is resurrected. But why is Jo, to whom he is deeply attracted, so reluctant for him to claim his rightful share? Renny feels the supernatural power of the 140-year-old covenant--feels it and wants it for himself. But when his life and Jo's begin to unravel, he is forced to face the truth about "The List." And nothing short of a miracle will save them from its grasp.	http://resizing.flixster.com/kr-MiUO-Fyb5J3CJms39hply3VY=/320x452/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/04/11180427_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/yPkEni5ydosTif-CZTG2NTRRYtQ=/180x254/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/04/11180427_ori.jpg	Thriller	Gary Wheeler	Michelle Hoppe (screenplay), Johnston H.

252	771256839	Foxcatcher	Based on true events, Foxcatcher tells the dark and fascinating story of the unlikely and ultimately tragic relationship between an eccentric multi-millionaire and two champion wrestlers. When Olympic Gold Medal winning wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) is invited by wealthy heir John du Pont (Steve Carell) to move on to the du Pont estate and help form a team to train for the 1988 Seoul Olympics at his new state-of-the-art training facility, Schultz jumps at the opportunity, hoping to focus on his training and finally step out of the shadow of his revered brother, Dave (Mark Ruffalo). Driven by hidden needs, du Pont sees backing Schultz's bid for Gold and the chance to "coach" a world-class wrestling team as an opportunity to gain the elusive respect of his peers and, more importantly, his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). Flattered by the attention and entranced by du Pont's majestic world, Mark comes to see his benefactor as a father figure and grows increasingly dependent on him for approval. Though initially supportive, du Pont's mercurial personality turns and he begins to lure Mark into an unhealthy lifestyle that threatens to undermine his training. Soon du Pont's erratic behavior and cruel psychological game-play begin to erode the athlete's already shaky self-esteem. Meanwhile du Pont becomes fixated on Dave, who exudes the confidence both he and Mark lack, knowing that these are things even his money cannot buy. Fueled by du Pont's increasing paranoia and alienation from the brothers, the trio is propelled towards a tragedy no one could have foreseen.	http://resizing.flixster.com/dElQBLB9gXZWf6EGrfOL96pvUP8=/320x480/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/04/11190435_ori.png	http://resizing.flixster.com/CI9edXrfggye6YeyR_zrP6Lh72M=/180x270/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/04/11190435_ori.png	Biography, Drama, Sport	Bennett Miller	E.

2328	771363461	Gerontophilia	Lake is an unusual boy: he is a young man with an old soul who discovers he has an odd fixation on the elderly. Realizing that some day, if fate allows, he will be one himself, he is particularly fascinated by old men. He imagines their age to be a beautiful thing and recognizes how these men were once young and vibrant and attractive, as he is now. Although Lake has a girlfriend his own age, named Desiree, he wonders sometimes if his fixation on old men is unnatural and unhealthy - perhaps even sexual. When his mother, who is a nurse, takes on a management job at an old folks home, Lake jumps at her offer of a summer job as an orderly there. Gradually, Lake comes to discover that the old people in the institution are being given psychotropic drugs to keep them in a catatonic state. Lake befriends one old man in particular, Mr. Peabody, who still seems to have some fight left in him. They begin to form a strong bond. Mr. Peabody charms Lake with romantic stories of his youth and confesses his dream of seeing the ocean one last time. Avoiding the vigilant eye of Nurse Stone, who administers shots and pills to the old folks, Lake starts to wean Mr. Peabody off his medication. Eventually, Lake springs Mr. Peabody from the institution. Together they embark on a road trip telling everyone they meet that the old man is his grandfather and that they're driving to the Pacific ocean. After numerous life-changing escapades, Lake is finally ready to accept his true feelings for Mr. Peabody, but everything changes when the trip takes a sudden turn.	http://resizing.flixster.com/k1uwinSlvUM6WuMNjhqa2Hdd2EQ=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/12/11191208_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/ju0qtbFpX9sSW5g-ppxXW41XC-c=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/12/11191208_ori.jpg	Comedy, Romance	Bruce La Bruce	Bruce La Bruce (story), Bruce La Bruce (screenplay), Daniel Allen Cox (screenplay)	26 Mar 2014	08 Jun 2015	2015-05-01	2015-06-08	82 min	$4.8k	Pier-Gabriel Lajoie, Walter Borden, Katie Boland, Yardly Kavanagh	43	gerontophilia	4.3	gerontophilia	4.3

While she narrates a piece about how she likes the predictability of asteroids, some placidly drifting asteroids are shown colliding in chain-reaction fashion.

Ted yearns to reconnect with his unhappy, medicated wife, Misty, but she's too far gone to respond and is driving him away. His daughter Sunshine contends with her unhappy, mentally ill mother and her own isolation issues. Events finally come to a head at a Christmas party when a rapidly unhinging Misty decides everyone needs to play the "Truth Game." Just when it seems like everything's falling apart, a celestial event shakes everyone to their core, reminding them what their real priorities in life should be.	http://resizing.flixster.com/nBnFijwnQPXqTrB_41Fm2PMcjUA=/320x473/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/70/11177037_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/tKsQhVaFavsIg4EH2eDXdahtrIk=/180x266/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/70/11177037_ori.jpg	Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi	Jack Plotnick	Jennifer Elise Cox (screenplay), Sam Pancake (screenplay), Jack Plotnick (screenplay), Kali Rocha (screenplay), Michael Stoyanov (screenplay)	08 Mar 2014	30 Sep 2014	2014-09-19	2014-09-30	93 min	N/A	Patrick Wilson, Liv Tyler, Marisa Coughlan, Matt Bomer	67	space-station-76	6.7	spacestation76	6.7

1502	771363533	The Wonders	Gelsomina's family functions according to very particular rules. First of all, Gelsomina, at twelve years of age, practically runs the family. Her three younger sisters obey her and work under her watchful eye. But the outside world mustn't know anything about their lifestyle, and they should be kept away from it, well-protected in their isolated countryside home. Gelsomina's father, Wolfgang, is a foreigner and Gelsomina is the future queen of this strange and improbable kingdom he has constructed for them. A male heir would have been better, of course, but Gelsomina is strong and determined and what's more, she has a special talent for beekeeping and making honey. It's Gelsomina that retrieves the swarms from the trees, who organizes the honey extraction, and she is the one that carries the hives. Whilst all around them the countryside is being burnt up by pesticides, rural life is falling apart and becoming something different, a TV show competition arrives from the city offering a cash prize and a luxury cruise for the Most Traditional Family. "Village Wonders" is presented by the good fairy, Milly Catena. Gelsomina wants to participate in the contest, but Wolfgang won't even consider it. Something else is tormenting him: the new European laws regarding farm produce. If they don't get their honey lab in order, with washable walls and well-defined working spaces, they will have to cease production. They have to work very hard to expand the bee colonies, and get the lab up to standard. In his desperate search for cheap labor, Wolfgang agrees to take on a delinquent German boy, Martin, who comes from a youth rehabilitation exchange program. The tension mounts: between a silent evasive boy onto whom Wolfgang projects his desire for a son, and, counteracting this, the outward reaching force of Gelsomina that will stop at nothing just in order to see the good fairy TV show hostess again. Nothing will be the same at the end of this summer for Gelsomina and her family. An extraordinary summer, when the strict rules that hold the family together, begin to break...	http://resizing.flixster.com/YL89XoUaluuJ-BfdDyRRWsICpw4=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/82/11188237_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/DsyA0ZSJzNQF2Bdug2iJqLP3g08=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/82/11188237_ori.jpg	Drama	Alice Rohrwacher	Alice Rohrwacher	22 May 2014	N/A	2014-03-18	2014-03-17	110 min	N/A	Alba Rohrwacher, Maria Alexandra Lungu, Sam Louwyck, Sabine Timoteo	\N	the-wonders	0.0	thewonders	0.0

The vacuum created by this silence has been filled by sensational mass media depictions of addiction that continue to perpetuate a lurid public fascination with the dysfunctional side of what is a preventable and treatable health condition. Just like women with breast cancer, or people with HIV/AIDS, a grass roots social justice movement is emerging. Courageous addiction recovery advocates have come out of the shadows and are organizing to end discrimination and move toward recovery-based solutions. The moving story of The Anonymous People is told through the faces and voices of the citizens, leaders, volunteers, corporate executives, and public figures who are laying it all on the line to save the lives of others just like them. This passionate new public recovery movement is fueling a changing conversation that aims to transform public opinion, and finally shift problematic policy toward lasting solutions.	http://resizing.flixster.com/V8VQ-0J9DfoHxj8boH5FBTT2mc0=/320x449/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/62/11176299_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/IKKMiB1tjjfIwf2ZxcU9FhBZxbw=/180x252/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/62/11176299_ori.jpg	Documentary	Greg D.

With a body unlike any before hers, she mesmerized viewers and choreographers alike - her elongated, race-horse physique became the new prototype for the great George Balanchine. Her unique style, humor and authenticity redefined ballet for all dancers who followed. Amazingly, she was the muse to not one great artist but two; both George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins loved her as a dancer and a woman. Balanchine married her and Robbins created his famous version of Afternoon of a Faun for Tanny. Tanaquil Le Clercq was the foremost dancer of her day until it suddenly all stopped. On a tour of Europe, she was struck down by polio and paralyzed. She never danced again.	http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/59/11175954_320.jpg	http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/59/11175954_det.jpg	Documentary, Biography, Drama	Nancy Buirski	Nancy Buirski	30 Sep 2013	23 Jun 2014	2014-02-05	2014-06-23	91 min	N/A	Michael Stuhlbarg, Jacques d'Amboise, Jerome Robbins, George Balanchine	89	afternoon-of-a-faun-tanaquil-le-clercq	8.9	afternoonofafauntanaquilleclercq	8.9

1024	771379347	Victor Crowl's Freedom	In Victor Crowl's new dramatic musical feature film "Freedom", we are taken on a melodic, rhythmic, dancing, emotional journey, filled with love, affection, forgiveness and redemption. The film begins as Victor arrives home in Toronto after traveling through Ethiopia, Jamaica and America, searching out his roots and the family he never knew and sharing his music with the people he meets. When he returns to Toronto, he finds that his love and compassion are desperately needed in his own circle of friends. The film tracks us throughout the summer of 2011 as his attempts to enrich the lives and relationships of young people struggling through bullying, racism, emotional, physical and sexual abuse. As he breaks down barriers of intolerance and bigotry, the people his actions affect find inspiration in him. Through his heartfelt, up-beat, catchy, and positive music, he is eventually able to bring both conflicted sides together. Victor's affirmations and encouragement shows young people that there is a way for them to fully believe in themselves and all of their potential. He wants them to find the gratitude in their lives, and to see all that they've overcome on their journey to find their freedom.	http://resizing.flixster.com/YJgzfXo7jOrSPkxTvNRoQRJRs7E=/214x317/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/76/11177619_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/r7WOt9MfAZfOimRM9gf6vvxCkfw=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/76/11177619_ori.jpg	Musical	Victor Crowl	N/A	06 Sep 2012	N/A	\N	2014-07-22	114 min	N/A	Victor Crowl, Vikki Velenosi, Calvin DeSalle, Zach Nash	\N	victor-crowls-freedom	0.0	victorcrowlsfreedom	0.0

They aim to demystify the BDSM lifestyle, and to serve as an example and an educational resource for the BDSM community.

774	771381297	Enemy of the Reich: The Noor Inayat Khan Story	From PBS - Enemy of the Reich: The Noor Inayat Khan Story brings to life the story of a woman's extraordinary courage, tested in the crucible of Nazi-occupied Paris. With an American mother and Indian Muslim father, Noor Inayat Khan was an extremely unusual British agent, and her life spent growing up in a Sufi center of learning in Paris seemed an unlikely preparation for the dangerous work to come. Yet it was in this place of universal peace and contemplation that her remarkable courage was forged. In early 1943, Khan was recruited as a covert operative into Winston Churchill's Special Operations Executive (SOE). Churchill's orders: to "Set Europe ablaze". After the collapse and arrest of her entire network, Khan became the only surviving radio operator linking the British to the French Resistance in Paris, coordinating the airdrop of weapons, explosives, and agents and supporting the rescue of downed Allied fliers. Betrayed by a French collaborator after four months, Khan resisted brutal interrogation by the Gestapo, escaping twice--only to be recaptured and sent to Germany where, at last, she was executed at Dachau.	http://resizing.flixster.com/DlfLZVtttoZK4gKSwc7TydcnKRg=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/84/11188462_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/s4XFYYmAGj5YDJMYUq7KOgS08SM=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/84/11188462_ori.jpg	Documentary	Robert H.

After Hallam brutally slew four deer hunters in the area, FBI Special Agent Abby Durrell turns to L.T. Bonham-- the one man who may be able to stop him. At first L.T. resists the mission.

But when he realizes that these recent slaying is the work of a man he trained, he feels obligated to stop him. Accepting the assignment under the condition that he works alone, L.T. enters the woods, unarmed--plagued by memories of his best student and riddled with guilt for not responding to Aaron's tortured letters to him as he began to slip over the edge of sanity. Furious as he is with his former mentor for ignoring his pleas for help, Aaron knows that he and L.T. share a tragic bond that is unbreakable.

1678	771379451	Lincoln@Gettysburg	From PBS - How the telegraph helped Abraham Lincoln to reshape America. In 1863, Abraham Lincoln proved himself a master of a new frontier--not on the battlefields of the Civil War, but in his "high-tech" command center, the War Department Telegraph Office. The telegraph was the "Internet" of the nineteenth century, and it gave Lincoln powers of command, communications, and control never before exercised by a commander-in-chief. He used this new technology to connect the country to him--receiving nearly live dispatches via telegraph from his generals in the field and sending out his plans for the nation faster and with more clarity than ever before. The results of Lincoln's pioneering experiment in electronic leadership would ultimately lead to the fields of Gettysburg.

When rock star sensation, Scottie B., falls prey to the demons of fame, she escapes the music scene only to find herself face to face with her destiny once again and even greater challenges when she inherits a little bar that was once owned by a woman with the same spirit and voice of an angel. This exciting rock and roll adventure shot was in the desert of California and the low country of South Carolina. Angel Camouflaged is the journey of SCOTTIE, a rock and roll singer whose struggle with substance abuse causes her music career to implode. Scottie bails on her manager/brother, MORGAN, to hide out in the Mojave Desert. Her peaceful new life is disturbed when Morgan calls and tells her that they inherited a bar in far-off South Carolina. Scottie is hesitant to take Morgan up on the offer, but tragedy once again plays his heartless hand and changes Scottie's mind and circumstances. Scottie hits the road with nothing but her tears and her guitar. When she finally sees the bar, she's horrified, the place is completely in shambles. Scottie and Morgan find themselves in a hostile world of raging motorcycle clubs, gun toting gang bangers, a satanic flesh merchant and a deadly neighbor who is hell bent on sabotaging their efforts to survive. Drowning in a sea of despair, Scottie learns from her departed aunt to see her true spirit and rise above her tribulations and fight the demons bent on her destruction. This film is rock and roll music, it's old west-style bar fights with a little Southern Mysticism mixed in. It's a wild, emotional adventure about the will of a brother and sister who find the strength to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.	http://resizing.flixster.com/G7V4do2nKMntPeqUj45Fj3C8pb8=/214x317/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158931_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/Py-0Cw5u-0pVfGGE53FC5X6mIDg=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158931_ori.jpg	Drama, Music	R.

At first the children enjoy carefree days amidst unspoiled nature far away from adult supervision. But their life changes dramatically when they come across what they believe to be a small dog, badly in need of help. The creature - known as Pochi - turns out not to be a dog at all but an alien on an important mission. It seems there is a mysterious substance on earth that is coveted throughout the universe. Pochi had almost found it but was so badly injured during a fight that he had to give up his search. Thanks to the children's help, the alien survives - and decides to reward them generously. "Where would you most like to travel?" is the question Pochi puts to his rescuers. Their answer is prompt, if vague: "As far as possible!" Pochi suggests they try the moon first of all, and so, the alien whisks away the kids to the satellite next door. This marks the beginning of an absolutely amazing adventure. During the course of their travels they discover that the substance coveted throughout the universe is in fact also integral to Japanese cuisine - and it just so happens that one of the kids has some of this mysterious substance in his pocket.	http://resizing.flixster.com/Foidpl3CH9E1GwLJuv-nvWlsPWA=/300x422/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/66/11156640_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/65Y_iL17j4IXbicJe97lCu9GY1k=/180x253/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/66/11156640_ori.jpg	Animation, Adventure, Family	Kôji Masunari, Masaaki Yuasa	Hideyuki Kurata (creator), Hideyuki Kurata (screenplay), Kôji Masunari (creator), Tomonori Ochikoshi (creator), Stephanie Sheh (english script adaptation)	26 Jun 2010	11 Nov 2014	2013-12-20	2014-11-11	136 min	N/A	Tomoyo Kurosawa, Honoka Ikezuki, Takuto Yoshinaga, Tamaki Matsumoto	\N	welcome-to-the-space-show	0.0	welcometothespaceshow	0.0

1524	771361097	Khumba	A half-striped zebra is born into an insular, isolated herd obsessed with stripes. Rumors that the strange foal is cursed spread and, before long, he is blamed for the drought that sets into the Great Karoo. When even his father, the leader of the herd, blames him for the lack of rain and the subsequent death of his mother, the outcast zebra leaves the confines of his home knowing that he cannot survive in the herd without all his stripes. Khumba ventures beyond the fence - vulnerable to the ferocious Leopard, Phango, who controls the waterholes and terrorizes the animals in the Great Karoo. Khumba is rescued from an opportunistic wild dog by a quirky duo: a wildebeest and an ostrich. Mama V is a self-confessed free spirit who does not want to be the average stay-at-home mom, like other wildebeest. Ironically, she mothers Bradley, a flamboyant but insecure ostrich who overcompensates for his scraggily feathers. When a mystical mantis appears to the foal, drawing a map to what could be interpreted as either water or stripes, the duo join Khumba on his quest in the hope that their own search for a safe waterhole is over. On their journey, Khumba encounters a colorful range of characters including a migrating herd of Springbok in search of greener (and safer) pastures; a new age, bohemian community living safely within the confines of a luxurious national park; an endangered Riverine Rabbit who has survived extinction by mastering a myriad of skills ranging from impersonations to beat-boxing; a group of hysterical Dassies (rock-rabbits) who fanatically worship the Mighty Black Eagle and Nora, a loony, solitary Merino sheep living on an abandoned farm. Through these interactions, Khumba begins to learn that diversity is essential for survival and that one's difference can, in fact, be one's strength.	http://resizing.flixster.com/_X8qCSWFtKOkfMBKaJKty4vpQoE=/320x475/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/42/11174269_ori.png	http://resizing.flixster.com/2Sif5phwcJuLrN76e_YgtwTyfmU=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/42/11174269_ori.png	Animation, Adventure, Family	Anthony Silverston	Raffaella Delle Donne, Anthony Silverston, Jonathan Roberts (additional screenplay), Camilla Bubna-Kasteliz (script editor), Richelle Wilder (script consultant), Mike de Seve (additional dialogue), Dave Bejoya (additional dialogue)	25 Oct 2013	10 Mar 2014	2013-12-06	2014-03-10	85 min	N/A	Jake T.

Despite her connections, Elham is unable to help Pari in her hour of need. Despondent, Pari wanders the streets and chances upon Nayereh, a woman about to abandon her young daughter. Pari tries to stop her, but it is too late. Soon after, Nayareh, falsely accused of prostitution, is taken into custody by the police.

From cable television to the computer, from Facebook to Twitter, Mr. Black rages about the prison we've insanely created for ourselves. He snarls at the country's failure to find alternative energy sources while creating cell phones out of the realm of science fiction. He mauls our nation's leaders for their laughably inept handling of social security and health care--and failing to provide help on any level whatsoever. As Mr. Black puts it, "What are you going to do when the Democrats are dumb, the Republicans are stupid and the Tea Party doesn't even know what day it is?" He takes what makes us crazy and makes it funny. It's a night of live comedy you won't forget. . . but if you do, it's probably because you're taking a drug that lowers your cholesterol.	http://resizing.flixster.com/W0Zos0PhIaLAxYh_xkueL_xhRKo=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/98/11189822_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/A9GHtESWKEdNbUaagUJvau9xwvo=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/98/11189822_ori.jpg	Comedy	Zach Nial	Lewis Black	06 May 2014	N/A	\N	2014-05-06	N/A	N/A	Lewis Black	\N	lewis-black-old-yeller-live-at-the-borgata	0.0	lewisblackoldyellerliveattheborgata	0.0

1001	771359010	Keep On Keepin' On	First-time director/drummer from Australia, Alan Hicks, convinced his surfing mate and cinematographer, Adam Hart, to travel to the U.S. to follow and film 89-year-old jazz legend, Clark Terry (Quincy Jones's first teacher) over four years - to document an unlikely mentorship between Terry and a driven, blind piano prodigy, Justin Kauflin, 23. Clark, now 93, mentored Miles Davis as a young musician and is among the few performers ever to have played in both Count Basie's and Duke Ellington's bands. In Keep On Keepin' On, as Justin is invited to compete in an elite, international competition while battling terrible stage fright, Clark's health takes a critical turn for the worse. Over the course of filming, Clark loses his sight, which deepens his bond with Justin. As clocks tick, we are suddenly witness to two great friends tackling the toughest challenges of their interwoven lives. The film, from the producer of The Cove and Chasing Ice, captures the passing of the torch from a cultural icon to potentially his last student, inspiring viewers in climactic, cinematic fashion.	http://resizing.flixster.com/lLxrISZTnha7yo6R-xYRa_ZX1TQ=/320x474/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/92/11189295_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/zscrc-KfVhi9Q1QZFXY_WVwZYUQ=/180x267/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/92/11189295_ori.jpg	Documentary	Alan Hicks	Davis Coombe, Alan Hicks	05 Mar 2015	13 Jan 2015	2014-09-19	2015-01-13	84 min	$0.2M	Candy, Terri Lyne Carrington, Quincy Cavers, Bill Cosby	97	keep-on-keepin-on	9.7	keeponkeepinon	9.7

1222	771377255	Mirage Men	How the US government created a myth that took over the world. ET visitors... crashed UFOs... back-engineered alien technology... the government cover-up of a secret that would change the world as we know it... These are the core elements of the modern UFO mythology, a story that has captivated farmers, princes and generals for generations, and shows no sign of loosening its grip on the popular imagination. But what if, instead of covering up the UFO story, elements in the US military had actively encouraged it as part of their Cold War counterintelligence arsenal - manufacturing the myth of the UFO as a powerful weapon of mass deception and the perfect cover for all manner of clandestine technologies and operations. Now, for the first time, some of those whose actions have directly shaped the UFO mythology, and some of their victims, tell their stories, revealing a surreal disturbing and sometimes tragic sequence of events that is part Manchurian Candidate and part Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Mirage Men draws viewers into a saucer-shaped hall of mirrors, a shadow-world where every lie contains elements of the truth, and the truth is far stranger than the UFO believers, or their detractors, would have you believe.	http://resizing.flixster.com/zP-lniA5nmX-TSJAvDB8ehU75GM=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/84/11188404_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/Ziict_MgPek2HTUGVo6z0EA5tNg=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/84/11188404_ori.jpg	Documentary	John Lundberg, Roland Denning, Kypros Kyprianou	Mark Pilkington	27 Mar 2014	02 Jun 2014	\N	2014-06-02	85 min	N/A	Rick Doty, Paul Bennewitz, Greg Bishop, Walter Bosley	\N	mirage-men	0.0	miragemen	0.0

It appeared the 44-year-old alcoholic, having slipped into a booze-and-pill stupor, drowned in her own bathwater. The death was ruled accidental by the authorities.

Now add two dead parents, a self-centered and greedy girlfriend, and no money left after Grandmas purchase to pay your last semesters law school tuition or Grandmas rent. And because the petty and miserable Dean of your law school wont sign a regularly-approved tuition waiver form, you're in trouble. Meet Danny Cuemdumpstier (Sam Cohan) and his life. Also meet his boss and father-figure, Jerry (William Forsythe), who works as the schools janitor full-time but on the side carries out all scams imaginable. His favorite is the slip and fall. (verb. To lie on the ground and scream like you are hurt when you are not and then sue and collect cash from anyone you can possibly say is responsible). And, its the answer to Dannys problems according to Jerry. Take a fall, or lie down is more like it, and scream. Now Danny is a nice and naive kid who questions it over and over and wrestles with the immorality. And he is dubious throughout. But with no choice, he takes the fall. And he screams really loud. Of course, the Emergency Room finds no neck injury, but then he is in Jerrys hands. Jerry refers Danny to his special circle of friends: a muscle-headed lawyer obsessed with sexual conquests, drinking and tanning; his chiropractic doctor with the imprimatur of an online degree; and a physical therapy center that doles out favors to its clients. Stunningly, this cottage industry generally prevails, but when it comes to a Cumdumpster, only a path of outrageous hilarity ensues. Oh, and by the way, Danny falls for the lawyers assistant because everyone but Danny knows that three doesn't make a crowd. What happens when a law student breaks the law on his law campus to pay his law tuition?	http://resizing.flixster.com/uR4fmAVdzeirEJt_fx3_ij14xe0=/284x405/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/69/11176906_ori.jpg	http://resizing.flixster.com/8QJFE1PLihJPG-2wC9c3HynIdY4=/180x257/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/69/11176906_ori.jpg	Comedy	Marc Colucci	Jason W.
